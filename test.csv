Amazing food 😇 Loved the taste ❤️;50;
Food is just yummy!!!!!;50;
Good service and good food I liked it.;50;
আপনারা যদি বুকিং দেয়ার পরেও মানুষকে জায়গা দিতে না পারেন তাহলে বুকিং নেন কেনো? দুপুরে বুকিং দেয়ার টাইমে ওকে করলেন। ৫টার দিকে গেলাম ২টেবিল নিয়ে বসলাম আপনারা কিছু বললেন না। ৬টার দিকে বললেন একটা টেবিল ছেড়ে দিতে হবে একটা টেবিলে বসতে হবে(আমরা ১০জন ছিলাম, আর টেবিলগুলা ছয়জনের)। কিভাবে দশজন লোক ছয়জনের জায়গায় বসবে? আপনাদের ওয়েটারও এটা এক্সপ্লেইন করতে গিয়ে হেসে দিসে কারণ কোনোভাবেই সেখানে দশজন লোক বসা সম্ভব না। এরপরেও আপনাদের এত সমস্যা আপনারা আমরা যাওয়ার সাথে সাথে কেনো বললেন না সমস্যার কথা? জানালেন ছয়টার পরে, যেখানে ইফতারই হয় ৬ঃ৪৫ এর দিকে? যাই হোক, ফেসবুকে রেটিং নেগেটিভ নাম্বারে করা যায়না। ভালো থাকবেন।;10;
খাবার মান,দাম দুইটাই ঠিক আছে। Good all the time;50;
সুস্বাদু এবং চমৎকার ব্যবহার!প্রতিটি জিনিসই tasty।;50;
জায়গা টা সত্যি অসাধারণ ছিলো। খাবার ও আড্ডা দেওয়ার জন্য আবার আসবো;50;
It's best���;50;
Food is just awesome;50;
Good food & ambience.;50;

FOOD AND THE SERVICE WERE REALLY GOOD! GOOD LUCK...;50;
Delicious;50;
Just wow;50;
So much mismanagement...they r not even capable of running a restaurant.... . 7.30pm over hobar por o restaurant ER manushjon khabar pay ni... . I repeat,it was 7.30pm..n we were not served ifter..ajan dise taw janay nai....we had to come out without having ifter...n in stead of saying sorry,the waiters were laughing.... seriously... -___- Place: Cloud Flame Service: -10000000/10 Taste: we were not that much fortunate to taste their platter... Suggestion:never ever go there...spend ur money at good place;10;
Food Quality : 9/10 Decoration : 7/10 Behaviour :10/10;40;
I liked the pasta and the drinks were average and costumer service was average but the pasta was very good and the price was also good;50;
Service is very slow and poor which is beyond minimum acceptable lebel.;10;
For pizza and pasta I will give them 100 out of 100.supre yummy �����;50;
Very � testy food.... The offer and service....;50;
Everything was good! Mostly the food and environment was lovely! Though the service was little late!;40;
Found worst service ever I had... they have to be update... need trained waiter...;10;
food taste are great...specially pasta, pizza are awsome...;50;
Khaber onak valo but vat onak bashi rake & place ta r atu boro hole valo hoito.;40;
The taste that brings me back �� Keep it up!!! Just wow!!!;50;
I tried their pasta and burger for several times..It was damn so good.The stuff's behavior is also very good.;50;
Worst service and worst food quality specially pizza..�;20;
(Their behavior & service both was horrible ..They served pasta with out spoon.. They forgot to give sauce & mayonnaise... we asked..After 15 minutes they gave sauce & mayonnaise..Drinks was very little amount though price was 25 tk..pizza was like a normal bread with cheese..didn't find any chicken pieces). It was my 1st experience But now their service & food both improved.... This time I am fully satisfied.. :-) :-);40;
I took BBQ meal, chicken was good but rice quantity was so less. Need to improve;10;
We went for the buy one get one offer!! They said- the offer is only for large bowl when we asked for regular bowl.(the offer was for regular bowl too..they tricked us).this is how you run your business??!!! Really disappointing!! Earning money by deceiving your customer,too bad..the pasta was not up to the mark however. Overall,it was really bad.never going there!!!;20;
"I odered ur ""pizza barsa"" today. It was home - delivery nd buy 1 get one offer. I'm sorry to say but im much disappointed. Cheese nd toppings were really poor. Feels like having a bread with a bit cheese nd some chunk of chicken which u can hrdly found. Please try to put some more attention to ur food rather then offers. Thanku.";20;
Their amazing platter is good enough , but AC is not enough for the restaurant.;40;
They really deserve 5 � star because of their food quality, taste and of course for the behaviour of their staffs...they were too much polite!! Really had a great time at the charming place!! ��� The pizza and pasta was really delicious, yummy ��;50;
We tried the Americano pasta, it was really tasty And we got an offer too on this item! The environment was awesome and their behavior was nice as well.;40;
Naga pasta awesome chilo... Taste 10/10 Price: valo kisu khete gele price doesn't matter, but price vat included thakle beshi khushi hotam..� Suggestion: Chicken ektu beshi hole valo hoto. poriman e ektu kom chilo..� Service :- 9/10 ( Ektu early service dewa doorkar) Over all shob thik chilo....��;50;
It was good though but the prices are very high.;40;
Oder service onek valo.... Ar food onek taratari day.... It just make me happy on my birthday... ��;50;
Me and my friend ordered Chicken cheese blast burger..according to name there wasn’t enough cheese..there were green spots in both of the bun..oil was coming out from the burger in every bite..according to price it wasn’t fair at all..;10;
Ordered special mixed chowmein 1:2, 2 choco cold coffee, 2 pcs fried chicken, chowmein was just average given to the price it could have been a little crunchy, coffee was good, but the chicken was terrible as I couldnt find a single piece of chicken flesh in it, taste was awful later I complained and they replaced it with a better version of it. I will have their pizzas next I visit no more above mentioned;30;
First time I was gone there. Place is soooo narrow & table is looks weird in this Restrurent. Service wasn't good enough. There was only 1 person who was on duty to take orders. About the food - chicken fry was good enough but pasta Basta was too much sweet in taste. That's why can't rate high. But painting was really amazing.;30;
"Service poor .. I wait 1 hour for 12"" pizza.. taste not so good .. Overall 1�";10;
Poor service.;10;
I visited Could Flame this afternoon. Loved their food and service. Nice atmosphere and they were really friendly as well.;50;
Worst experience ever. Need to change the chef asap.;10;
Pasta is the best.. environment was awsm...service was too good.. �� love it;50;
Akdom different taste... thanks....arokom e jyno taste n quantity thake;50;
ENVIRONMENT WAS GOOD,SERVICE WAS BETTER & FOOD WAS EXCELLENT. I AM SO HAPPY.....;50;
Environment is 2 Good,,,, I just loved it... Food is not so tasty � but Behavior etto Valo J r Kisu dorker e hoi na...... Not soon expensive.... So okay �;30;
"Tried out the set-A. The pizza was really delicious, pasta and chicken wings were yummy as well but didn't like the sub at all. Btw, the interior decoration made me feel like I was sitting in a Greek restaurant; great job!";40;
They really deserve 5 🌟 star because of their Ambience,food quality, taste and of course for the behaviour of their staffs...they were too much polite!! Really had a great time with my beloved one at the charming place!! 😊❤💕;50;
Service was very good. They served very quickly. And we loved the foods. It worth visiting there.;50;
Good food, price ok but management toooooo bad. Because their is one person who taking all the orders and surveying the food. It's obvious that he can't managed all the things alone. It's 3rd time in @[1798844937050755:Cloud Flame] but last 2 time I got too much disturb. About last night, that was worse!!! I like the food but I maybe can't convince myself to go their for the 4th time.....;30;
Worst experience ever ��� Atto faltu service!!! khilgao elakay ato faltu obstha kokhono dekhi nai.. table vanga vanga rong nosto hoa... AC theke pani pore sit vije jacche... shob kisu chawa lge...even pasta pizza serve kore jay without spoon � 10 min dhore dakar por spoon diye gese! tao spoon boltesi bujhe na � ha kore chilo pore chamoch bolse r gese ante!!!!! r khabarer test o joghonno..pasta to rekhe e uthe ashci.. kno ingredients nai only jhol r pasta!!!;10;
Its ok about thr burger, I thought the bun quality needs to be improved, thats it!;30;
First time in Cloud Flame. Liked this platter Set B. Service was good. Environment nice but place not large. And table are not accepted in this restaurant. Food was too good also quantity. Specially I loved Burger also sub sandwich. �� Taste:9/10 Service :10/9 Environment:8/10... Place:4/10;40;
Food was really Yummy..I enjoyed it very much..And the place is also good..;40;

U guys r awesome... I loved ur food,taste,environment nd service.... keep it up.....���;50;
Awesome food.. With awesome taste.. Tried their offer platter.. Every single item was perfect.. Keep it up...;50;
Went There Today At 4:20pm For The Buy One Get One Pizza.Asked Them If The Offer Is Still On They Looked At There Hand Watch (Offer Valid Till 5pm) And Said Yes Sir.I Was About To Make The Order And Suddenly He Said Sorry Sir We Can't Take Your Order Cause There's No Electricity. Huh Seriously? -_- Good Luck To You Guys �;10;
That was great.. nothing to say ,you guys give us that satisfaction again �;50;
অনেক দিন পর ভালো পিজ্জা খেলাম...জানি না আপনারা ভুলে ভালো পিজ্জা বানিয়ে ফেলেছেন নাকি এরকম ই বানান..!!! খুব ভালো ছিলো...;50;
Food quantity & quality was very good..i tried their iftar platter last day,...price was justfied wid the food..environment & sitting arrangement was average but service was good...all above it was a nice experience...;40;
the ramadan special platters are worth every penny..i wish the place was a little bigger and less noisy..give it a try..you wont regret. :);40;
They still didn't manage sufficient electricity supply when there is power failure. Tried the set A, they couldn't even serve sub and chicken fry. Had to wait till the power came. The pizza was average and so was the pasta. Chicken fry and sub was quite good though. It's been around 4 months since they opened it and they still didn't fix the electricity issue, and still didn't start accepting card payment. About the AC, they don't turn on all the ACs all the time, so you may... sweat at times. Should work on these things, to satisfy the customers. Price is reasonable according to the FOOD QUALITY. Hope for the best.;20;
awesome place and yammy food...................................................(y);50;
It is a lovely place and the food was too tasty..I went there 5-6 times,every time I took different food and all time the taste was quiet different and so delicious and their price is perfect.. I love this place a lot.;50;
Bad food quality Service is not good And They are very slow.. Allover bad experience;20;
awsome place and food quality is good but bbq not as good....smelling chicks blood...they dont take so much to serve food...overall good place...also very good for couple who like to spent some moment personaly;40;

বার্গার অনেক জোশ ছিলো। পিৎজা ভালো লাগে নাই। ইন্টেরিয়র ডিজাইন মোটামুটি। ওভারঅল বেশ ভালোই। কিপ ইট আপ �;40;
the food was tasteless. idk if they reduced the quality due to the offer or not,but seriously the food is too bad;10;
a perfect place of delicious food and unique service. The most loving thing is their reasonable price, where u'll get maximum food in minimum cost�;50;
খাবারের মান ভালো � পরিবেশ সুন্দর � ১০/১০ ��;50;
Best cheesy pizza in Khilgoan !!! ���;50;
A very good place and the service was awesome BUT there is too much onion in your burgers(I ate the shake shack and juicy lucy).you should reduce the amount of onions :) apart from this everything was money worthy;40;
Environment & decoration is really nice.. I loved those paintings � food was also really good. We ordered arabian chicken rice bowls, thick Thai Soup, & coffee. Rice bowls were really nice as it was spicy (bcoz I love spicy food). Lastly loved their coffee.. it was a good coffee. I would love to go there again and taste something else.;40;
Enough cheesy .... Loved it;50;
Decorations are nice. Overall environment is like fish market. Peoples talk so loudly. Generally peoples come to restaurant not only for quality foods but also for having some quality time with family or friends. The restaurant management should control this to maintain a good healthy environment.;10;
delicious pizza fall in love�environment is nice also served with good staff.;50;
এসি দিয়ে পানি পরে , আর সব আইটেম সব সময় থাকে না ! সবচেয়ে খারাপ ব্যাপার পানি ও সফট ড্রিংকস এ ভ্যাট রাখে !;20;
Good for a perfect pizza.............................................. :-);50;
Service is very poor......waiter didn't serve food properly...in the middle of our meal a begger enter in restaurant and ask money from us....;10;
Got home delivery today of buy 1 get 1 Pizza offer. They served with ample sauce and mayonnaise. and the pizza bread was of perfect thickness. Much satisfied with the overall services.;50;
the pizza offer was great tastes good serving was late... bt overall was good;40;
Aj 3ta Arabian rice bowl bashae parcel kore nicilm. Test:8.5/10 plz khabare kom oil use korben. Otherwise valo cilo. Poriman:10/10 Service :9/10 Thank you.. �;40;
The choco cold coffee was awsome.. and also the thai soup��;50;
Taste of their food is really delicious and their behaviour is also good and polite.I just love their Pizza.I want to visit their place each and every time <3 <3;50;
Burger & Pasta Basta Best <3 Enviroment Behaviour just Wow <3 :);50;
just awesome,keep it up.....:) best of luck 2 ur future;50;
Yummyyyyyyyyyyyy............ I really loved pasta basta... ��������;50;
This is a great place for having food. Their interior is quite good,food is good. They need to include some set meal in their menu. The behaviour should be slightly improved.;40;
Nice restaurant... Amazing pizza! One of the best I have tasted... Loved your service...;50;
Went there to avail an pasta offer! Found that the offer was totally wastage of tym n money .They r offering one small pasta free with large one.But the quantity is very poor.It seems lyk they just divided one pasta into two bowl.Cheese and meats were very little in amount and the so called large pasta is very expensive and small in quantity. Service is really poor.;10;
Good food quality.. Super service... Well decorations....;40;
Loved their food and decoration. The interior gives comfort to eyes. and food was really good.;50;
Nice ambience! Overall food was delicious! Will come again! Soon!);40;
Really verry delicious your all foods. if i didn't take all foods. but I'll meet your all foods soon. In Sha Allah!;40;
The environment was lovely, and the pizza was amazing.. we will come again..�;50;
food is just too good!! All the best Cloud Flame!!;50;
In one line,aaaammmmazing food service and staff behavior.... luved it....;40;
Loved the interior of the restaurant. A good place for hangout with friends and family. If I say about the food, the taste was good. Specially the pizza section was enriched enough. I'm pleased with their well behaviour. Overall My rating is 5 out of 5.;50;
One of my favourite place in khilgaon these days Foods r very delicious specially pizza and pasta r mouth watering... It doesn't take more than 15 mins to serve food Service is really good...;50;
I loved it...Best PIZZA....nice environment..super sound system....Yummy Yummy Food;50;
Quality N quantity of food both R high... nice environment.. with great service �;50;
The food and environment there is awesome. service is also nice.sound system is fantastic.will definitely recommend to friends and family.;50;
Nice restaurant. Tasteful decor. Amazing pizza! One of the best I have tasted. Could do with more selection of desserts. Service was good as well.;40;
The foods great!!! Loved the environment and the buffalo wings are my favourite;40;
Amazing experience .. Tasty foods... Beautiful interior... One of a kind...! :);50;
"It takes not more than 10 mins to serve food. Food is fresh and tasty.! Once u start to have the food, unless u take a sip of coke u won't gonna stop.! A place with beautiful lights and photographs. This is the place for everyone; it's a friendly place, a family time spending place, a romantic place, a meeting place, a warm place to have food.!";50;
I tasted very poor quality food served by them yesterday. The food was so salty that I had to push them to change it. Though they changed it on my request but it was salty on 2nd attempt as well. Every time, they took 25-30 minutes to serve food. However, I had wonderful food experience at star lounge before but I don't think I am going there again. They have changed their chef which they admired on my query. Upon my complaints, the manager even didn't bother to apologise, rather she was irritated. Waste of money now a days!;10;
whats a food? Its more then my expectation. I loved and enjoyed it. The food was very testy and Yeamme. Obesly i will come agen.;50;
"The horriblest pizza I have ever tasted! the service was shockingly bad!! Looks can deceive!! the environment looked good, but food was bad,hospitality was worst! Had to call 3 times for order,they were too busy.....the pizza was ""chicken lounge pizza""! Crust was too thin, sooo hard couldn't chew,no scent or sign of chicken....they didn't serve any sauce,tissue,napkins,though asked 3/4 times....their price is overrated, proportion is insufficient.... asked for the bill 4 times,lastly had to go to cashier to pay...didn't even give receipt...after hearing our complain the manager didn't even apologise!!! just utterly shocked!!";10;
|Few days before Eid-ulFitr we had ifteri at your place but number of items served against the price 500 Tk per person was not impressive. The rice was not properly cooked and almost the whole dish was served cold. Since it is a renowned restaurant in the town should pay more attention for improvement about food and hospitality to retain customers.;30;
I went there with my family & found that most of the cheap foods are not available. only the can offer the expensive ones. food taste was also horrible. behind, just 1 glass of cold drink, they charge 80 taka. isn't it too much. I mean adding 20 taka u can get 2ltr. where they are giving us abt 120ml costing 80 tk...!!!! we took Peri Peri Chicken package. but didn't taste good at all. Last of all..... NOT RECOMMEND.;20;
"The quantity of food is not enough proportionate to its price and the foods are too spicy; not easy to have.hospitality and environment are not bad !!";30;
Service was very slow as i checked in there on previous week for ifter. I'm not also happy with food quality as i found very light-wattery Halim with tow piece of bone!!! It really shocking. Tea wasn't also good. It was not creamy at all. Only environment was good there. Hope it'll improve..;10;
I hv tasted chicken satay & lemon ice tea.its delicious & environment is also cool but they r not well behaved. So keep eye on that note.;30;
They served the order after 45 minutes. When we asked they told chicken just arrived. Peri Peri chicken was half cooked. Very expensive. Service very poor.;20;
Best ambiance in Bashundhara city Mall. Reasonable prices and great food. Even better services. Servers have co-operative and can do attitudes. Will love to visit again.;50;
its a good place but price is relatively higher then the food item;30;
Presentation is very good..food is awesome n the environment is very peaceful overall very good place for hangout;50;
very bad service. They are unable to give buy 1 get one offer through VISA card due to their network problem. they are very much unprofessional.;10;
They serve the food very slowly... One item served 30 min later of the 1st item that we ordered..;20;
Finally found a decent eatery at Bashundhara City! Food was good, service and ambiance even better. Looking forward to visiting again.;40;
the worst food i ever have....... food quality & taste is very bad..... but toooo expensive....;10;
Cheap quality food served at high price. just disgusting.;10;
Over priced.... pizza was hard.... food is average according to price bt drinks r good.....nice environment;30;
Worst food! Totally disappointing for such a well ambient restaurant. Too bad. Tried pasta nd buffalo wings;10;
Environment is good but food was not tasty enough;30;
good food good environment reasonable price great place for hang out;50;
Good place to hangout but food needs big improvement.;20;
Food is yummy.. I like environment but plz don't play always English stupid songs... do something different.........;40;
Service quality is great, food is also good.;40;
Good ambience great price :) Totally worth it :D;50;
Its good Actually i like to sit there rather than eating...;40;
Great iftar menu & nice environment. best in Bashundhara city............ :-);50;
Food taste is not good.but environment is awesome.;30;
Just wasting of money . Stupid food and price.;10;
Food was toooooooooo bad..will never visit there again;10;
Awesome Environment. Great service. Delicious food;50;

Well;30;
sooooohort.......Bar na gele keyo bujstei parbana.;50;
খাবার এর মান খুবই জঘন্য। ঢাকাতে এর থেকে বাজে খাবার আমি কোথাও খাইনি :/;10;

sorry to say,had their set meal bt the food was worst... chicken was undercooked and disgusting smell....we won't go again..never go there ....;;VERDADEIRO
Overpriced. Very bad. the pasta was definitely the worst thing that I ever tasted. Strongly recommend everyone to avoid this place.;10;
Best taste................;;VERDADEIRO
We have ordered setmeal-5. The food taste was awful. We didn't even eat the curry, because it was way much salty. The bill was to higher 1001 tk. Sorry Kitchen's Story, we won't come again to your place.;10;
I have bought 14inches pizza with 2 free large pasta offer for 850tk and additional 15%vat. The quality of pizza is simply disaster. Crust was burnt, only few pieces of chicken found here & there and cheese quantity was also not sufficient at all. So called 2 large pasta were another nightmare. You can imagine the taste from the pictures above. Tastes raw. Not recommended for anyone.;;FALSO
"we took the by one get one free pizza offer (12"") and the taste was soo good alhamdulillah! � Keep it up! Best wishes for you! �";50;
This restaurant's Pizzas are awesome!;;VERDADEIRO
Had chicken pasta and cashew nut salad. Pasta was very bland. Not enough seasonings and lack of any kind of taste. Amount of meat or mushroom was tiny. White sauce they surved was weird and . Couldn't eat half of the pasta. Cashew nut salad was below average. Chicken in the salad was probably a few days old.;10;
We visited the places at evening and it completely empty. We stayed there around 1 hour, not a single person came. ....Now I understand I should have a look the reviews before go. it's not about the environment or people over there, but the Food. I don't want to say it Worse or Spoil food, but the Food has no taste at all. The Burger 🍔 taste like Bread and Chicken without salt. The Pasta - it seems to me that I had a bowl of water with some cheese.....disgusting. Chicken Fry (leg) overcooked. Very much dissapointed of overall experience as we went with Family. I guess weather they are going to close their business very soon or they have a bunch of BigHead (!) chef (?) with bad tamper. 😠;;FALSO
Best pizza. It was gravy and cheesy at the same time. And the burgers were soooo amazing. I loved it.;50;

First of all give up the habit of hawking people like Gulistan to your restaurant..Haven't seen this ever at any elite restaurant of this area.. . had pasta here which was 3/5.. it lacked chicken and cheese horribly..you can hardly find any of these in the middle and last parts..I should also personally say it lacked salt and spice(don't know about other people).. I think you guys need to stop the buy 1 get 1 shit and instead bring up your focus to the taste... for decoration I would rate 4/5.. it looks good overall thanks to the decorators.. Best of luck for future.. hope you guys can make quick improvement and cope up with the other famous restaurants in the food valley named Khilgaon �;30;

Ordered Thai soup and two set meals. The taste was good. But should work on the pest control as I saw a cockroach on the table.;30;
One of the worst pastas I ever had.. worst service & worst overall..;10;
The unlimited pizza was bland with 1 average flavour and the service took too long;20;

Amazing taste of food. Service is also nice. I heard about this place from one of my frnd and went there with my brother.Two times we have been there.the first time we went , wasn't very sure about the taste of authentic pizza taste of there but when we ordered and ate the chicken pizza it was quite good. the other day we ordered a lot ,though peri peri chicken platter was too spicy to eat..yet they tried to manage upto it. overall a nice place to have good food and hang over;;VERDADEIRO
Excellent food, nice space...;;VERDADEIRO
We had to wait more than one hour for food .. and later we asked for additional salad and they failed to serve that on time . ( Our food was finished by the time they served it) . About the food : ordered hariali kabab with garlic nan. Kabab was good but couldn't find any difference between garlic nan and regular one .;20;
It was over early period when we visited this place.Really nice and budget friendly place for pizza lovers.;;VERDADEIRO
The taste of the pizza was very bad. Although they say the cheese will be more in chicken Supreme pizza, There was no cheese in pizza. Very dirty places.;10;
Given the price it was hard to believe they were able to pull it off....kudos to you guys. Good for a date . Good for a casual hangout or a meet up. Best not to bring family here though as the customer base for this shop is mostly teenagers or people like me with a shallow pocket.;50;
1. The crust was really thin, almost like a Ruti. 2. Amount of cheese was not bad. 3. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant, there was hardly any chicken even masroom in the chicken supreme pizza. You can also count the olives. 4. The overall taste was good but for 279tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention. You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Definitely overhyped and overrated. Best of luck.;20;
Well the crust was really thin, almost felt Like a Nun Ruti. Amount of cheese was okay. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant in the beef pizza. Portion of beef is again okay though there was hardly any chicken in the chicken pizza. You can also count the olives. The overall taste was good for 200tk. But considering the toppings, 200 tk is not cheap rather an okay price tag. They only have 8 inch pizzas. For a guy like me, I could easily eat Two and go for ...;30;
Well as i was born and bought up in this area I had basically tried all kinds of food around this place...so not gonna lie.... Now about pizza....i basically like it cause the crust the flavor all of it is good like if u expect to have a real pizza there are other places for that this pizza is for people who eats outside regularly and want some good food in a cheap rate.This is why i said good instead of 'soo good' Told ya not gonna lie About the place and environment - it's ...;50;
mouth watering pizza..its affordable n very very tasty. quality amount of cheese n other stuffings are find as good in one pizza. smokey flavor is just the hero of it. best of luck pizza live! keep hold ur quality n don't lose ur customers faith..�;50;
"Their behaviour was bad, i repeat their ""BEHAVIOUR"" was ""BAD"". We wanted some change as we gave all of our ""khuchra"" tk at the time of order. But they didn't even have the courtesy to say politely that they didn't have any change, it was like we were beggars asking them for money. We ordered both chicken and beef, the amount of chicken was really poor, it was really a fancy cheese version of typical local pizza. So don't get confused by the price.";10;
Very Good and Delicious Pizza;;VERDADEIRO
I have waited more than one hour still the food was not ready!;10;
Food really good!! and there service also...;;VERDADEIRO
Double cheese pizza like '#Meat_Lovers' is a bit salty. They should try other kind of cheese. Otherwise they are good �;30;
Mouth watering pizza..its affordable n very very tasty. quality amount of cheese n other stuffings are find as good in one pizza. smokey flavor is just the hero of it. best of luck pizza live! keep hold ur quality n don't lose ur customers faith...;50;
It was really amazing! Though it take one hour to get the pizza but trust me after the first bite i forgot all my tiredness! Enough toppings, cheese and other integrants are okay! Would like to recommend you to place another matir chula! :p;50;
It is a great initiative. Taste is up to the mark. I love the smoky flavor from Wooden burn oven. Some obstacles are seen but they are ignorable as they are a newbie.;50;
"Their pizzas are just average. But behavior is quite extra ordinarily ""POOR"" we ordered 4 pizzas costing about 860. We paid them with 100 taka notes. But later on we wanted to give a 500 taka note instead of those 100 taka notes because it was urgent to have some changes. But, man o man they were like, ""who are you?"" even after explaining the incident the guy who was taking order didn't have the conscience to even say sorry. Frustrated with the behavior!!!!";10;
A nice and decent place to chill and good food! <3;50;
the Ultimate Adda place and best place to hangout as well as the only wood fire pizza in Dhaka;50;
Chicken pizza was so testy nd yammi. Service was quite a bit slow but all the best.;50;

Pizza live's pizza was really awesome & price was also reasonable. I took their chicken supreme & its crust was thin, topping was stuffed with chiken. Their behavior was also good but they took too much tym 2 serve.;50;
the worst.i found a big hair on the crust and they didnt even apologized.never going back there and food was not upto the mark.;10;
Must try best pizza in town and the owners are very well behaved .;50;
It's amazing if you visit here you will be satisfied..... And I become a fan of the pizza live... Wow the taste is on my toung yet..;50;

Food quality is so so poor!! 😖😖😖😖;;FALSO
Food was great, service was good too just lack of good management I guess cause to run the buffet restaurant u must need 3 people to take the empty plates from the table during people having their food. But I didn't see anyone there to take the empty plates. They did took the plates but after people left from the table. Its just lack of training.i worked and study in hotel management abord and I run many places abord so I have bit idea in hospitality sector so I hope the management will see my review and they will fix those small issue. Also they should serve proper roasted bean coffe to keep up the class. Overall I had a good time with my boys.;50;
Very friendly & cooperative environment for group lunch and dinner.;;VERDADEIRO
Last night I along with my 03 colleagues went there for buffet dinner. The items like beef or mutton curry were not up to the mark, meat lovers like us may be disappointed. 02 items of soup, fried chicken and noodles were good. Surprisingly, we found no item of prawn. We felt salads and dessert items poor and limited. I found small hair in different dishes which disturbed me a lot but I did not say anything as my mates could lose their appetite. Ambience and behaviour were good. Overall response is that Tk 800++ price for that standard buffet dinner is quite much and they must improve to ensure hygiene.;20;
worst buffet. soup was horrible😞😞😞😖😖;;FALSO
The environment was great, liked their services​ and they all were well mannered! Some people had bad experience​ about their services​ but this wasn't the case for me. Actually they were great for me. Whatever lets talk about the food! 1st of all there wasn't 50 items as they claimed​! And most of the items were good but not the best!! Fried rice and noodles and chicken chili was great. That tikka item was great. The biggest downfall is, there wasn't any beef or sizzling items!! I didn't liked the pasta...it was bad! And you guys should add more desserts please, Because the desserts​ sucked big time! I would never recommend shemai and firni in a buffet menu!! At least throw some cakes or chocolates. Maybe you guys mixed up the menu because of the Ramadan! I hope you will improve the menu in future! Thanks for your services ��� ���;40;
very good food and place you can come with family;;VERDADEIRO
Yesterday it was embarrassed for me. Significantly detoroiate the cooking quality. Hopefully this restaurant will shut down suddenly. The worst restaurant in Dhaka city. Try to avoid this restaurent. Huh!;10;
It was a nice night indeed.;;VERDADEIRO
Serviceman behave very bad to the customers.they underestimate their customers.food was average. But the food is not the fact.the fact is they directly argued with the customers.no policies.contains plenty of cheatings.their attitude and expression will mean you that they r teaching you and you r first time in restaurant.many worst policies they have which they wont mention you.most attentional sight was many worst policies you will see from them which you will never find anywhere.honestly I can say that if any one gathers here you won't came here for second time.and also reviews them 0.5 out of 5 ratings.im giving 2.0 ratings cz the food was average good that's why.but if I focus on behavior and policies I will rate it 0.5 out of 5.;20;

We had a get together here on december 12.we triedd the lunch buffet there. The items were okay but not extraordinary. Desserts were very ordinary.But the employees were pretty well behaved and ambience was really good �.... They let us stay till 5pm even after the buffet was closed.. . .. Its a good place to hangout with friends and family � �;40;
Overall food is good. However, there is a improvement opportunity in desert items. Like to provide two quality items instead of 4 average items. Pasta could be a better one instead of macaroni and the sauce used in crab need to be a quality one. Others are up to mark.;40;
The worse buffet restaurant in Dhaka City. Totally waste of money. The price was too much (Tk :1k) for dinner buffet. On the other hand, quality and taste of the food ......totally rubbish. ���;10;
Worst buffet in the city. According tomenu and food quality Price should have been 450 including vat .;20;
The food was average. But I and my family having loose motions after having their buffet dinner. Very much disappointing. I wish i could give them 0 out of 5. The only perk would be their service. Service was good and prompt.;10;
Last night I was there... soup was awesome... I liked their pasta... I really don't like their desserts... I was expecting more dessert there...#payesh,shemai are the common dessert.. we can eat at home... I think you guys should add more dessert there... Overall Thnq...;40;

As usual a nice place to hang out. They should to be more careful about their desert items,others were ok. Hope they will introduce more new and tasty food items in their buffer menu �.;40;
Food are good but behavior of the waiter are not good and system of their bill is unusual and what is the service charge about??????;30;
"Very simple comments- I think food is ok. All over lack of business attitudes. •Ice cream was finished before 10PM and they replied ""it finished"" what kind of chit attitude was that. It's a restaurant that, shouldn't think to second time visit.";10;
Food was good, but food service management was average. Otherwise it's cool place, specially the roof top.;40;
Behaviour was not good. Lackings of food iteams in buffet. Taste was not up to the mark. Additional 10% service charge which is too high.;10;
beef and mutton item were not upto mark..otherwise ok.. dessert item should be increase.. their pudding and finni were so yum and pasta salad.. other items were not that good;30;
awesome foods with well service. nice place. guys should visit this place;50;
Not so special, dessert items are very ordinary, food quality are ok. But items reduced than last visit. With compare to price its only fair in my opinion.;20;
Dishes were good, tasty. Food bowls were taken good care to fill up frequently. Liked the environment. But seems like very noisy. Price BDT 800 + 15% VAT = BDT 920. NO BEVERAGE CHARGE! whereas other buffet charges extra for beverages...;40;
BDT 800++ price for this type of buffet dinner is quite much. They must improve the quality and ensure hygiene.;30;
Food Service quality is good, but price is high,Its a good place get to gather family or official program.;50;
Good food, great place! Recommend for any family event and buffet.;50;
Food test was excellent. Quality is very nice. service support was also well. price is reasonable.;50;
Totally waste of money. One of the worst buffet in the city.;20;
Had buffet here last day!! Chicken fry, Fried rice and Thai corn soup were quite good. Desserts were exceptional(I had 3 times :-D ). Other dishes were bellow average. Lacked fruits. Overall good experience.;30;
Awesome... Enjoyed iftar and dinner chicken and beef was very tasty;50;
the environment was very very nice and the food.. Just great and cost effective! loved that place! :D;50;
it was a nice restaurant ,spacious,and truly nice environment .;40;
The food items of this restaurant are delicious. Specially I will never forget the tastes of salad items.;40;
Simply the food was awesome. .... as well as the atmosphere. ...;50;
Every food item's are so testy. Environment is awesome.....;50;
Poor ! Poor ! Poorest quality, in my experience. Not recommended!;10;
I am boring with the service,i wanted soft drink twice but denied, it was horrible experience;20;
Overall food is good. However, there is a improvement opportunity in desert items.;30;
Worst experience. Their service and behaviour to the customers is disgusting. It has disappointed me much.;10;
just visit atleast for once...hope u will like it...;40;
Beef was hard to chew.didnt find any prawn dish...;30;
Excellent buffet , amazing food and helpful service. :) Must visit once.;50;
Waiters are not well manared....they are like #Shit;20;
Foods: worse Desserts: worst...i mean 'shemai' in dessert​..how come -_-;10;
Food quality is good and taste is also good........;40;
desert is getting too much worse ................ :3;30;
My House's Number Seven Link Road Banglamotor Dhaka 1000 Khanu Bhaban We Are Enjoing Sevenhill Restaurant Buffet Dinner With Cousin's Friends. Our Best Choice Will White Rice Dal Fish ... Just Realty Iteams;50;
Environment: 8/10 (Nice) Food : 5/10 (Below average);30;
Last Night I Went There With My 3 Friends For Buffet Dinner. As I Know The Buffet Price is 800 Taka But They Charged Us 1000 Taka For Each Buffet. So They Set Our Total Bill 2080 Taka(Including Vat) Which Is 400 Taka More. Now That's Very Disappointing From a Restaurant Like Sevenhill.;30;
Excellent Restaurant In Bangladesh I love this all food.;50;
Nice resturant.Specially Buffet is awesome!!!;30;
Though there was a lot of lacking, but overall satisfied..;50;
yeah obviously better while 50% off...............;50;
nothing to say;30;
SERVICE WAS AS USUAL. THEY SHOULD NEED TO CHANGE THEIR DISHES AND ABOUT DESERT , THEIR DESERT IS POOR . OVERALL IT'S OK TYPE. ..;30;

Enjoyable space...Good experience. ....foods r tasty....❤�❤�❤�;40;
Because Quality of restaurant. I loved it.....:);50;
Yaa I tasted all of their food kuz I, m related with cricket board and they r our caterer for all international tour.;50;
The ambience is good but we had issues with the food as the shrimp dish was stale and after complaining they compensated with a delicious lamb dish which was specially cooked for the members of the Bangladesh Cricket Board members.;20;
Great food!!! Delicious, fresh and mouth watering! LOVED IT!! And very impressed with the service!;;VERDADEIRO
Great food at reasonable price. The portions are large and adequate amount of toppings!;;VERDADEIRO
I would surely recommend Slice O' for the taste and ample amount of meat, and considering their price, it's definitely value for money. Oh and from my experience, they are quite customer friendly!;;VERDADEIRO
This is by far the best pizzas I've had here at BD. Made by a man full of passion and dedication, I'd rate this a 10/10. The presentation of the pizza is beautiful. Its very neat and pleasing to the eye. I personally had the BBQ chicken pizza and the shrimp pizza and it tastes amazing. The meat is well cooked and tender. The meat alone tastes outstanding. The texture of the pizza is wonderful. Though it is layered by the sauce and meat and the cheeses on top, it still holds everything in place. It doesnt get soggy or soft which is essential for a good pizza. And not to forget, every bite gives you a very satisfying cheese pull which is to die for 😍 Overall, i would highly recommend.;;VERDADEIRO
Great pizza, delicious cheese overload. Must try bbq chicken and tonduri chicken pizza. If you want different taste , try their tuna pizza. I love it;;VERDADEIRO
Best 🍕Pizzas!! Highly recommending!;;VERDADEIRO
definitely the place you can rely om when you have cravings for pizza!!!!!!!;;VERDADEIRO
The best homemade pizza in town now;;VERDADEIRO
Deliciousness at its best!;;VERDADEIRO
Pizza is really good n also reasonable 😊;;VERDADEIRO
If u guyzz searching for mouthwatering cheesy pizza then go for #Slice0', u can get ur desired pizza in Dhaka city by order through hungrynaki! undoubtedly 🍕🍕 Trustworthy page! 🍕🍕;;VERDADEIRO
Hands down the most meatiest, cheesiest pizza in town!!;;VERDADEIRO
koshaaaaaaaaaaa pizza, na khaile apnar jibon bertho!!!!;;VERDADEIRO
"thursday i visited khilgaon branch with my friends for iftar. With a great expectation we ordered two SET FOR 2 items, but after seeing the platter we were at a loss that ; as the platter including that pizza and pasta was totally a joke!!!!!!!!!!!! at first pizza was 6 inches , and we cant choose any flavor, secondly we were not allowed to choose pasta too. and lastly when we started eating the pasta was nothing but only boiled pasta with no flavor at all. And all this cos... a total horrible experience and we never expected that. At least you should had maintained your pizza and pasta quality. A totally overpriced platter. i am a regular customer of alfresco dhanmondi branch , but i must say khilgaon branch must be the worst.";10;
quite good and stuff were friendly ❤;;VERDADEIRO
I ordered pizza italiano via foodpanda. The crust was very undercooked. The edges got burnt yet which doesn't make sense. The toppings were not sufficient.;20;
really noce n good also delicious;;VERDADEIRO
#Pasta_Al_Fresco clearly it's going to make this place down... if this is the title dish then you should just go to hell dear cause this was not pasta actually it was some mayonese and tomato sauce dipped macaroni in lots of oil... where we didn't find any shrimp... very less mashroom... not as mentioned in the menu..and instead of cheese they probably gave flour coating :v only view cannot make your ratings up... have you ever had a good pasta? then you should know...that ...;10;
I ordered 2 items and that were pizza jalapino and alfesco special fried chicken and besides soft drinks. Really that pizza was yummy and full of cheese as well as special fried chicken was delicious in taste. I liked their environment as well as their service that's why I hitted 4 stars..;40;
I loved everything I have eaten so far!! Delicious;50;
Good food , nice place to hangout..the waiters are nice ..combine everything with budget food pricing and you have a awesome place to go anytime you want with friend to have a great time;50;
Keep it up.And all the best.;50;
Gd place to hang out. service was gd. Food quality, taste and service is good. Among their menu, Pasta & Pizza r best I can say. environment was good, but food price was little bit high & quantity was less;40;
1st time I was visited khilgau Alfresco with my family. It was Roof top restaurant , I ordered pasta basta ...environment was good, service was also good but food price was little bit high and quantity was less !!!!!!!!!!;30;
I ordered American chopsuey...it was yummy like their beginning days����;50;
Well, it was probably not the alfresco which created the hype. Took the couple's platter, set B and thai thick soup. Soup was by far their best punch. Others were just avg food we have in normal chinese carts. And red velvet cake was just disastrous. It was very dry. Ambience was ok.;30;
So today was my bday ......i ordered 2 pizzas and 1 pasta-basta .......the pizza was tastyy but the pasta-basta was awfull and so disgusting yuckkkk��i was shocked after tasting it man it was just raw boiled pasta with some cheese on top nothing else man never ordering pasta again��;30;
ami gotokal giesilam...ei nie 2 bar gelam Al fresco te...1st din pasta r thai soup order koresilam...thai soup er quality ak dom e poor silo ja bola bahullo...r jhal silo onk... soup er modhe prawn r mashrum kisui silo na...chicken silo but tao onk kom...r pasta silo motamuti...gotokal order koresilam BBQ Pizza...etar quality silo medium... overall Its not so good in quality food & service also....sorry...but its true... :(;20;
It's overpriced. If it's a costly restaurant then the food must be of that quality, right? The quality of food is nowhere near the price. The set menu was okay-ish. The American chopsuey wasn't that good. But the dessert was good.;30;
went there some days ago with my wife.took platter 1 of DRW2017 offeer.she enjoyed the food and said that the pasta was the best among she tasted and i agreed too.....;40;
Too pricey and overrated. They added a thin slice of lemon in a glass of coke and the price was 25 tk. Also the taste of the menus were below average;10;
Its one of my favorite restaurant, it never disappointed my expectations. Keep it up Alfresco & all the best for the future.;50;
We tried the set menu. The taste was very bad. Recommend not to try the set menu.;10;
super duper yummy food.nice and clean decor. waiters are very cooperative. I would definitely like to go once again :D;50;
I'm still wondering what could possibly be the reason behind their pricing strategy ! Its extremely overpriced compared to their taste and quantity. Expected better !;10;
it was a good experience....yesterday I visited khilgaon branch of it. love the food pasta basta also my friends.. environment was good and their service also�;50;
Bad customer service;10;
They are so sweet � their pastas and set menus r fab � everyone should try them � and most importantly they gave me discount on my birthday :) thanks alfresco ur best�;50;
One of the best italian food restaurant in khilgaon.;50;
I Tried Pasta Basta from Alfresco Khilagaon Branch. Pasta was 9 out of 10 but the service by the waiters i didn't like. They looked so arrogant and irritating whenever i asked for something.;30;
Um sry. Food wasn't good. Chicken was bad. Rice was lil smelly. Overall it was a bad experience..;10;
good;50;
Worst food at good price. Waste of valuable time with money. Total loss.;10;
quality is not good like before, extra service charge is not fair;10;
Alfresco must stop somkeing at the roof top place its annoying me...;30;
Worst pasta ! But pizza is fine compared to pasta that's why it deserves 2stars .;20;
Expirence wasn't so good.....food was okay......specially pasta was good A bit pricey;30;
Both pizzas r delicious... four season & barbie que...loved it;50;
Great teast as well as service just wow ...... keep it up;50;
Awesome evening but a little bit crowd Overall it was nourishing;40;
Pasta Zaletti is awesome here��� I love the place as well�;50;

The Food quality and etmosphire both are awesome I really like it;50;
Italiano Pasta was jst awesome...i jst love it..best pasta ever!!;50;

They really need to improve their service Very poor service.;10;
Not bad..Liked the weather...Can be better...Hope they will do good..;30;
Cheap food, paid off, nice environment.;50;

place ... nice...but..বিকেলের দিকে গেলে couple বেশি থাকে তখন পরিবেশ family নিয়ে enjoy করার মতো থাকে না।lunch time এ গিয়েছিলাম.. তাই ভাল লাগলো। Set A order করেছিলাম। খাবারের test মোটামুটি ভাল ছিল... সালাদ টা তীতা আর Rice এর পরিমাণ খুব ই কম ছিল।Price & Vat মিলে অন্য restaurant থেকে অনেক বেশি খরচ পড়েছে।fry & chicken curry ভাল ছিল..;30;
1. Chicken wrap shwarma 2. Pasta- Basta ভালোই ছিল, খারাপ না।;40;

Great place to hang out with friends. Moreover the food was not bad at all. Actually it was quite better than many other pizza places...;40;
I just love their roof top and food is also good...;50;
good food for good people :) we feel better in here ..........hopes you will do ......;50;
The food was good so was the place but the waiters are just so weird.;30;
Today i went to this place n orderd their so called pasta basta n lamonade :/ after giving the order i told the stuff that plz dont make it spicy bt when the pasta basta has come that was too much spicy n taste oh watever srsly very bad,, n second thing in lemonade there was jst mint flabour n nothing else i cant even feel anykind of lemon syrup or related anything. So atlist m not going this place again :/ jst for their bad food taste.;20;
The Pasta Al Fresco was horrendous. The cheese layer was untearable and the whole thing has left a very bad taste in my mouth.;20;
I kept going back for the food n decor....but yesterday i ordered red velvet cake n it was the worst....it was so hard that i could not even chewe it properly......but the set menu which had yummy yellow i loved it like heaven... Please work on that cake...;40;
I dont know abt all of their foods, but whenever i think of Pizza & Pasta, two names come in my mind immediately- Al Fresco & Appliano. these two places are always 10 on 10. Yesterday we tried a Chowmin at Al Fresco- and it was .....what should i say ? Awesome, rocking.;50;
wrost food I have ever tested recently. Only coke was consuable.;10;
Best pizza � loved it.. and service was also good..;40;
One of my most favorite restaurants. Delicious food, nice environment and most importantly awesome behavior of the staffs and authority. Keep it up guys.;50;
Seriously... quality of foods are getting poor day by day.that dish *pasta italiano* was simply yuck and the ingredients which is in soup were smelt very bad.will never go anymore;10;
Quality of foods were just disgusting...;10;
Ami ekhane onek age theke khai ...even bondhu birthday bah event hoile ei jaga astam celebrate korte... thik aj k o celebrate korte bondhu der sathe kintu tader khawar age moto r fresh na .... thai soup e mangsho ebong chingri theke emon ekta gondho pailam jemon mone hoilo fridge e onek din rakha ... jak r ami ei alfresco te asbo na ...;20;
Dont tell me about the swarma it is the wrost swarma i have ever eaten.fucking taste and also i order american chopsy its so bad to eat.I lose my money on this fucking Al Fresco.;10;
I ate set menu. Test was mediocre. However, one year before, I also went there & enjoyed palatable dishes. I hope they will be careful about it.;40;
I love their foods ! It's a nice place! � Their pasta is a must to try! �;40;
Taste of Pizza & tandoori chicken was yummy . Undoubtedly better than others , I went Jigatola twice and had satisfied experience . Well mannered staff ,environment & Nice decoration.;50;
Nice place for enjoying food with family n friends.;;VERDADEIRO
Worst experience i have ever had I have seen a little cockroach in french fries, we ordered the combo package which includes two burgers, french fries, milk shakes, garlic bread, after having two or three french fries i have seen this little cockroach and we wanted to talk with the manager but he was not there and we didn't eat rest of the foods, i 'll never go there for second time...;10;
It was so bad. I had bad stomach problems after having your food. And the taste was bad too. 👎👎👎;;FALSO
Had pizza taste 9/10...chowmein with chicken and prawn taste 8/10...though I didn't had the food there bcoz I did take away but place and environment is very good... Main thing is that the restaurant is always open till 11:30.And u will get all type of food And quality is very good with good price;50;
"Very disapointed , pizza was not so good the size was too small , i ordered 8"" medium smooky chicken pizza but size was nt more than 6"" , m pizza lover nd had pizza in different places but nvr had a 8"" pizza so small, and the bread was so thick and less materials, bt the bbq wings were good, i liked that rather than pizza..";20;
Le pizzaria is a nice place with very nice decoration. Good music and all. Very well behaved employees.I am satisfied with its pizza's taste. It will get a rating of 8.5/10 from me in terms of taste. The amount of cheese is very low for me. I will suggest to go here if you want a delicious pizza.;40;
food was good. great environment for friends and family;;VERDADEIRO
Worst pizzas I’ve ever had in my life ! I mean seriously, u guys called them pizza? & those who’ve given 5 star ratings, have u guys ever tried pizza hut, dominos or atleast pizza inn ? Don’t confuse others by giving fake ratings, dats totally wastage of money. & Le pizzaria Stop posting totally thousands time different pictures of pizzas while promoting ur page!;10;
good one, i loved their offers...;;VERDADEIRO
Worst pizza place ever, the guy who speaks on the phone to take orders cannot be more disrespectful and arrogant. They promise one thing and deliver something unexpected. And on the top they put the blame on customers for their mistakes.;10;
#1_Star_Negative_REVIEW First the pizza was smaller than what they said it was, I was burnt on the edges. And it had hardly any toppings on it. We asked for extra bacon and did not get it. The waiter was not friendly at all...;;FALSO
Alas! There is no 0 star! Worst behaviour! A lots of mosquitos! And pizza is not that good. 😠;10;
staff ar behaviour kharap....;;FALSO
I had their pizza once, it was real good.;40;
it taste is really good. I like it and love it. nice.;50;
Thank you Le pizzaria Bangladesh, I have never seen such professionalism and immediate response in a long time. I complained only for a decent apology, but they returned so much love and food (a whole meal infact!) Thank you for being such classy gentlemen.. :) Best Of luck.;50;
Interior was good but it was full of mosquitoes.It's better to chew peanuts in zoo than having pizza here.The softdrinks they served was pale,may be water was mixed with it.And last but not the least rather most important thing that this place introduced us with a whole new definition of chocolate lava cake! they served doraemon cake (which anyone can find in any grocery shop,10/- each) with chocolate syrup on it & named it chocolate lava cake....�����;10;
very tasty food,cozy environment, well mannered employees...love the decoration.. nice place for hangout with friends and family;50;
Tasty food and good environment. Offer of pizza is reasonable.;50;
Place: Good Behavior: Average Price: Average Taste: Good Its a place to visit with frdz, not for couples. ...;40;
Bad experience!! Their medium pizza which they say is 8 inch, but when served it was 6 inch. Also the pizza was tasteless and it had little amount of cheese!! Never going back!!;10;
it taste is really good. I like it and love it. nice.;30;
in just 1 word..... it has worst taste,I have ever experiencedd.....;10;
The Best Pizza I ever had. Whenever I go there i called them and order my pizza. Never got disappointed of their service. i love this place. Hope the Quality will be always good as like now.;50;
The pizza was really too good and cheesy !! Well mannered and good services as well !!;40;
Le Pizzeria is best. R kono kothai hobe na. Service, price, place & test with all phase they r unbeatable. Keep it up.;50;
Nice place,good food & refreshing environment.service was good also.loved the place & will come again In Sha Allah :);50;
Ordered food and made payment like more than hour ago and just now they are delivering. Totally unacceptable. I had to call them more than 5 times, sent a boy to pick up later. A service which is unforgettable!!!;10;
Their service was very good.But they should improve their pizza taste..There's no special taste on their pizzas.. They put very less chess on pizza..so they should think about the taste..;30;
Today we try BDT 199/- pizza... so delicious and yammey. Thanks for being on time only 15min. All the best :);50;
yummy food with good taste.specially their pizza���;50;
Really it was so more teasted pizza I love it very much thanks 4 that..;50;
Worst pizzas! They doesn’t even taste like pizzas ! Don’t go there & waste ur money, because it’ll definitely result into making u regrets ! ����;10;

Worst pizza !! ... Too less cheese without any taste.. Forget this place if you want a better Pizza.;10;
Worst service in town...taste horrible... Pizza is not enough spicy and cheesy;10;
Le Pizzeria is best. R kono kothai hobe na. Service, price, place & test with all phase they r unbeatable. Keep it up.�;50;
Not a good pizza place.... But their behavior is good.;30;
Very good in taste! But, they should increase the quantity of cheese.. Size is also disappointed!;40;
Tried almost all of the pizzas they had on the menu, loved each and every one of them!;50;

"Dhanmondi branch: Poor service. Home delivery depends on there mode. Today's I called them to delivery but their feedback was "" lok nai sir, raining bla bla"" ( no rain � though)";10;
Worst pizza I have ever had....No taste & the price is very high.;10;

Totally disappointed with the taste. Probably it's because of the offer, but it tasted horrible;10;
I hate to give negative review, but your pizza is disgusting. Garlic Mushroom was good though.;10;
The best Pizzaria in town. I visit this place or order from them at least twice a week, and am never disappointed. Love this place I hope the continue providing the awesome service and those brilliant offers 👌🏻🍕💯;50;
I like beef pizza. .....I loved it.....sure eat it;50;
Love their baked pizzas, its reasonable and oven fresh than other places, only didnt like the fact that they havent improvise their washroom facility, which is limited due to their space. Hope they will work on expanding the space to improvise facilities.;30;
Best pizza in town!! And B&R is a tremendous bonus!;50;
Pizza was soo good and nice place..u must open brunch in dhanmodi area;50;
Best for pizza�✌ Comes again� need more item pizza� Let's go #la_pizzaria�;50;
They've a good ambience I must say. The service was fast and quick. The waiters were good at there job. But I didn't like the taste of their pizza and if you're not good at what you're offering then service and ambience won't do any good. There were sufficient amount of cheese but which tasted super crapy and I find the amount of onions were much more than the actual topping. I ordered the Family Size Double Trouble and Buffalo Wings. The wings tasted decent enough. So If before you visit this place give it a thought coz there are far better options. And Yeah The Pricing was okay for me not expensive at all and obviously affordable. Thanks;20;
In a word people will enjoy the food specially the pizzas are really delicious and quite different from other restruanant.....and I love the fraapee juice....;50;
The 199tk pan pizza offer makes me order 8 times a week! Never change!;50;
Nice..............................................;50;
Service quality was too much bad & pizza taste was medium not so good;20;
Today we try BDT 199/- pizza... so delicious and yammey. Thanks for being on time only 30min. All the best :);50;
any place which is liberal with their cheese is my favourite!!;50;
I went there couple of times and I am quite satisfied with the taste! Highly recommended for the people who like Italian food. And most importantly its reasonably priced.;50;
As a pizza addict, I am happy to be able to try this pizza parlour. The taste is so good that i dont mind eating it all in one sitting so far this has been the top of my go to place when i am craving for some good ol' cheesy pizza. I recommend the triple decker which you will more cheesy and flavorful. Have tried both the chicken and meat and i gotta love meat more. ? #Bbcgfsdxb;50;
I was in a mood for pizza today and wanted to try something new. After having received the ad cut menu on my door a month ago,B.B.Q Al Pollo pizza was on my mind. So decided to try it out today. Tried out the cheesy pepperoni pizza along with chicken wings. The wings were delicious, sweet and mildly spiced. The pizza was very tasty, had a lot of Parmesan, cheddar and mozzarella cheese flavour accompanied by pepperoni. This was fully satisfactory meal. Wouldn't hesitate to come back again.;50;
took the unlimited pizza+ drinks offer. very fast serving + lots of cheese + great test. definitely will recommend.;50;
Best pizza in town❤️;50;
"Got 2 pizzas an hour back through foodpanda. I must say I'm very disappointed with the amount of toppings you guys have given. The small squared slices of pepperoni was insignificant in the family sized pizza in comparison with the 900+tk you guys charge for one! But the amount of cheese surely covered the empty areas; no doubt about that! I'm sorry to say, but I'm never ordering pizzas from you guys.";20;
I must say Premium Tiramisu cake is one of best flavour I have ever tasted.Wanna buy it again & again ❤️;;VERDADEIRO
my daughter's bday cake was so delicious, beyond our expectation. of course nicely decorated too;;VERDADEIRO
I ordered a 4kg rainbow cake for my Office Promotional celebration and I got seriously ashamed because of your cake which tasted really bad.. The food color was too much, the cream didnt blend well...over all it was really disgusting. I spent 7200/- just to buy some criticism towards me... i will never ever buy anything from you.;10;
Everything is great. Always improving and introducing new stuff. love the cookies.;;VERDADEIRO
Yesterday, at the Gulshan 1 branch (opposite to DESCO office) of Coopers, I found the bakery section infested with insects. Instead of removing the contaminated food, the staff was busy in removing the insects after I showed that to him. It was a very disappointing experience. Please take prompt action.;20;
Team Coopers, I honestly could not have been more pleased with the way the design turned out. I came to know from my friend that you were dedicated and worked hard. Anika and I want to thank you for the beautiful cake you created for my mother's birthday! 💟;;VERDADEIRO

It was a great experience . The eatery, The food was awesome. Lots of variety. The dessert was amazing. Stayed at 19th floor. Had a view of Gulshan Ave.;;VERDADEIRO
A great property with world class service and delicious food.;;VERDADEIRO
Excellent Food, Excellent Service, Nice Ambience. It was my Wife's Birthday, so decided to had our dinner at here and got the window side table on 24th floor., Sunday, cuisine was Continental and Indian. We tried the continental items, and all the items were very good. The place is spacious. The dessert section was good too, especially their chocolate moose cake and another crunchy item, can't remember the name. Overall experience was very good, will come again.;50;
Beautiful ambience, Tasty food range and great view from 24th floor. All the waiters are very well mannered. This is my 3rd visit and It has already become my one of the favorite place to be ❤️;;VERDADEIRO
Like every year, came for iftar but could not find space at tower so called in a request to get space at the residence. On arrival we were very sad to see that there's no Cream Brulee served at the desert section. I casually asked the waiter about Cream Brulee & to my surprise he had called out the Pastry Chef Ms. Rishta who very politely asked for 5 mins. To my delight, she turned up with an amazing golden hued Cream Brulee! It was AMAZING! Absolutely delighted by the service and their readiness to go out of their line to serve Customers. Thank Madam Rishta. The cream Brulee was amazing :);50;
The view of the hotel from 24th floor is awesome. Well mannered waiters. Food quality is great. Healthy & tasty food. Nice environment.;;VERDADEIRO
Went there a week back for Iftar, very limited items were served (was quite surprised to see) and they were not refilling properly, some items were served after around one hour of Iftar. Dessert section was most shocking, I found nothing to take on my plate! It was anything but a five star standard where as they charged us the highest for Iftar in Dhaka!;10;
good food with variety, well mannered waiters, good service quality, quiet place, food lovers must like the place.;;VERDADEIRO
They didn’t mentioned any card serial numbers on their online promotions of BOGO OFFER.... asking for visa platinum debit cart they told that yes it’s available on it.. but after having lunch they said they have few serial numbers of cards only which can avail this offer.... this is totally harassing for a visitor who visited there after watching their promotions offer....;10;
Delicious food... Great ambience, nice view of the city and excellent service.;;VERDADEIRO
"We went there for our anniversary dinner date.. As it was on Wednesday, we availed the opportunity to enjoy ""Sea escape"" where there were many mouth watering sea food dishes.. We found grilled Pomfret quite delicious.. the lamb dish was the best among the main courses.. Desserts were good too.. We both loved the apple pie.. The staffs were very welcoming and Overall the ambience made our dinner date more pleasant..�";50;
Excellent service..splendid environment..enjoyed thoroughly..;;VERDADEIRO
Went there for the iftar buffet. Was decent enough. I liked the maki, red velvet and mahlabia. Rest were rather mediocre. Had the buy1 get 3 offer so it was okay for the money. But its not worth it to pay the full price.;30;
Its not for food lovers...Less buffet Items....Less tastes.....Less hygiene....I found hair in vegetable.....;;FALSO
Such a Waste of Money in their Iftar and Dinner Buffet , Food was cold late refile , no good taste of anything . Bad People Management as well it was like fish market .;20;
A very splendid place with great food and an excellent customer satisfaction service. Perfect & wonderful place to charm, organize and perform meetings. Simply the best... 👍;;VERDADEIRO
Worst service ever! We bought 2 coupons for the ‘boishakhi food fair’ on pohela boishakh and when we reach the restaurant (26th floor) they kept telling to wait because they were gonna shift it to lobby. We complained and they reluctantly served us food some food and kept us waiting for our remaining food while not even giving us any importance that we kept waiting (even though the food was ready). We got so annoyed we left without even eating. Waste of 1000tk coupon. Worst service and unwelcoming looks from the waiters as we waited for the food. NEVER going back;10;
excellent food environment is very good... service is excellent..;;VERDADEIRO
You should look to provide better deserts items. And during season in Bangladesh, mango should be a regular fruit item. Very good food.;40;
Great food. Good city view;;VERDADEIRO
I am very impressed by the friendly staff who are eager to help and make my stay pleasant. This alone makes the hotel the best hotel I have stayed at in my various regional travels. Good service, friendly smiles and great attitude. Love the hospitality. I will definitely recommend this hotel to all my clients and friends from Singapore!;50;
Delicious food 🥘 Have swimming 🏊‍♀️ facilities on rooftop !!;;VERDADEIRO

I have been there several times..n i must say i have always loved their cuisines, dish selection,presentation and most importantly taste of food....it has been an utmost satiating experience evrytime....;50;
Variety of food, excellent service, friendly environment, in a whole spent wonderful time at four points with friends;50;
Awesome food ... the steak.. the sea food thermidor.. the lamb dishes... just awesome...the desserts were too good.. nice environment and good service . I will go there again :) ....;50;
Most of the items are customary...... More food items should add.....;50;
I have tried their blue brunch offer. Every items were perfectly cooked. Staffs were taking care of the food section every time, that gives a good impression of a classy restaurant. The desserts are really good. I highly recommend to have their salads, fish, mutton steak and beef steak. I can't wait to share the wonderful eating experience with family and friends .. Please try to not waste food. They refill food time to time . Foods were excellent, environment was tremendous..., service was remarkable. I personally feel so bad when foods are being wasted.;50;
Good food. Professional staff. Nice ambience. Worth going back.;40;
It was awesome...Food was good... behaviour was good.Thanks once again...;50;

Love food 😗 Love ambience😌 Dinner buffet was awesome 😊;50;
It was just awesome! Enjoyed every item. I definitely want to go there once again to take its multi flavors. Hope, every time Four Points will fulfill my expectations. It's my belief.;50;
Really delicious foods are there! Splendid Fish dishes!;50;
This is one of Best Fish Festival I have ever seen Cooking was so delicious , Every item given test;50;
Sea food was fresh n good but they need to add more seasoning at the time of grilling... atmosphere was awesome n waiters were friendly;40;
Excellent. In all respect. Specially the food is delicious.;50;
I been in other 5stars in DHAKA, I found 4point Sheraton is a bit bellow rated . Verity of food was limited. Dining was not that spacious and they offers only plain water in their buffet. Only a few Deserts. However I liked their seafood verity.;30;
Nice place to stay. You will have good experience at the service of them.;30;
I had an awesome time! The food was so yummy that i couldn't resist eating even after being too much 'full' � specially one cake and the service was good too � I would love to visit again surely!;50;
I hope every things is fine-----------------------lot of thanks every one.;50;
I attended the fish market festival.....the variety and the teast of main course was way up to the mark.....loved it....however the dessert part disappointed me greatly.....but all in all worth spending.....satisfied not delighted;40;
Best Buffet Resturant in Dhaka Food was delicious and mouth watering Staffs & authority was very well mannered and friendly Interior was very well decorated & clean Although 10/10;50;
I wish I could have shared some pictures of food here ... food , ambience, service and their marketing strategy is really smart ! I have tried their blue brunch offer ... after having delicious heavy breakfast we used their swimming pool for an hour , relaxed for few minutes ... then we had our lunch ... every items were perfectly cooked .. staffs were taking care of the food section every time .. that gives a good impression of a classy restaurant .. and the desserts are re...ally good ... I highly recommend to have their sushi , fish and beef steak ... I am going to try their new offers soon .. can't wait to share the wonderful eating experience with family and friends .. P.s. Plz try not to waste food ... take small portion . They offer a lot and refill food time to time . I personally feel so bad when good food in fact any kind of foods are being wasted !;50;
Good food good environment what you need more when you visit any place � but their hall room temperature wasn't good enough :/;50;
Eatery is simply excellent, transformation on the items for the branch till noon is identical and candy for eyes indeed!! Great view from the skyscraper and swiming pool was just a compliments to an option to explore to observe the aesthetic part of the city!!;50;
Environment is cozy, though selection of food in restaurant is quiet limited. Staffs seems to be quiet new....lack of promptness is seen..hope it will be overcome soon.....pool is a very tiny one...Underground parking is steeper than any mountainous slope..........;40;
Brunch was wonderful. Staff are ver helpful and smily face always;50;
Had very wonderful experience with my family at brunch...;50;
Cozy place bt food is good.�.environment is good.;40;
We were 6 people went to Four points to have brunch yesterday. It was a good experience specially with the 1 hour complementary access to the pool. We had lots of fun there. The view was amazing. Ambience was good and most foods were tasty except the Hilsha fish. Staffs were good and overall experience was good. However they could add ice cream on the buffet and few more exclusive items.;50;
Warm welcoming along with excellent environment, services & security are really superb.;50;
First class service always a smile on their waiters face specially waiter Ankan and syed;50;
The Eatery has one of the best buffet dinners in Dhaka. Small but decorated and with a great view from the 24th floor. The grilled river prawns, beef fillet mignion, penne arabiata, teriyaki beef, prawn dopiaza, in house ice cream, chocolate mousse are a must try.;50;
Loved the food and service! Had the weekend brunch offer this Friday and it was absolutely scrumptious!;50;
their brunch buffet is the best buffet in town without anydoubt..and their service is outstanding ..behaviour with customers is extremely good...the food items are heaven ...extremely tasty;50;
A person who knows me can tell that I just live for good food and I love eating at different places where it is a 5 star or anything else. The Friday brunch of Four Points by Sheraton is awesome to treat yourself after a hectic week. It is a place which is very soothing and their staffs will make sure that you'll feel cozy there. I have been to Le Méridien, Westin and Raddison too but if you ask me which place serves you the best food then I'll say it is Four Points by Sherat...on. Now let's talk about the food, the best thing they will serve you is live juice station from the entire brunch session. The live kitchen has a variety of items to offer and to me the prawn tempura and the omelette with cheese were the best. They also serve you live pasta station. I had the best white sauce pasta with cheese, spices and chicken today. It was so yummy that I had the desire to start licking the plate. The main dishes were yummy too. The main thing is they will set a line of main dishes that you will want to eat like no dishes you'll not want to eat. I had a very good experience today there and I highly recommend this place.;50;
Their complimentary beverages services need to be improved.;30;
Not up to the mark........ Totally frustrating :/ :/ expected a lot better;20;
Its classy, elegant and the service is very nice;40;
Just 2 problems , in my opinion: ** Coffee = Needs to be NOT THIS MUCH LIQUIDY , NO MATTER WHAT THE BLEND IS. ** Price and proportion = especially coffee proportion... could be the opposite of the conventional. Lower the price and Higher the quantity and quality the better . Otherwise , the staff people , the ambiance all of it is Amazing .... !!! ... Thank you .;40;
I overall don't like this hotel.... Only photography is real.... Nothing else ...;20;
অত্যন্ত চমৎকার পরিবেশ। বিশেষ করে ২৬ তলার টেরেসটিতে বসে ঢাকার যে দৃশ্য দেখা যায়, তা অনন্য।;50;
My first interaction with four points was in the month of Ramadan during one of the Sehri. Since I was there with my friends, therefore I decided that I must get my family someday over here. Eventually I did, and I took the right decision. Perfect ambience, quality food and sober supportive staffs... Keep up your good works folks !!!;50;
The environment at the lobby is pretty good.However why does the building shakes so much at the 26th floor? It felt like a massive earthquake.;30;
The food 🥘 was very good 😊 . Love the deserts;50;
Food was really good with nice hospitality ..... ....;40;
Excellent food ! Loved apple salad during Sheheri ! Too good desert items;50;
I have tried both their Ifter cum Dinner twice in 2 occasion. The overall rating is 5/5, The dishes were unique and delicious, Environment was great, Ambience 5/5 Service was excellent, specially The F&B Manager Mr. Tareq was most cordial, they even surprised us with a Birthday cake for a friend.;50;
Well organized, food is just unparalleled!!! Really appreciate the behavior of their stuff. Best ifter of town with amazing view of Dhaka from 25 th floor.;50;
Good experience �. Good food with nice view, simple awesome;40;
The place was really nice...the quality of the served dishes were also up to the mark.definitely will visit again.;50;
Well we had 1 ifter and 2 sehri in Four points, it is one of the indication of their improved menu and services! As their tower section is the new addition in the Ramadan menu, I must said they are providing great foods. Ramadan teaches us not to waste, so i tried to eat as much as possible but not keep any weste foods in the plate! I like the most is they did not put tons of variety rather quality foods and all that you can eat. All the stuffs are very friendly, they keep asking the guests if they need anything more. They tried to provide the best possible service. Apart from that. The view from the 24th floor is awesome! The manager Mr. Tareq and assistant manager Mr. Shaifur Rahman provide quality service and they are always on the move, asking guests if they were happy or not! Overall, we are satisfied customers! :);50;
Nice hospitality. Go ahead . Wish all the best all member and Mar.;50;
The Sehri buffet spread were completely worth of the price for a SPG property. It was good in taste. Some items were just outstanding like The 'Paya'or ' or 'nehari' Salad and fruits bar was good and main dishes were mouthwatering. Second visit is awaiting sometime soon.;50;
They are charging almost 4,000 (3,999) BDT for the buffet but do not bother to make arrangement to keep the food warm. Cold food ruined the taste of the items. My brother went there with his guest yesterday & became embarrassed of the food situation. if you don't want to keep your kebabs hot, then don't charge that much cz other buffets are charging less but giving better service than you. Pissed Off;20;
I like the service and the making selection of food. I was quite please overall and looking to go back again.;50;
Good menu but mediocre taste. Nothing exciting to the palate. The fruit table was good as was the nehari. Other items were ... Just there.;20;
Below average standard .. Communication with clients is bad nd behaviour should be developed ..;10;
It was awesome. I wanna go their again. wish all the best;30;
Clearly a waste of time and money . The dishes were way below average . Nothing resembled the advertisement. Pure Deshi cuisine plus a few salads and desserts is not worth 2200 taka. Last but not least , the restroom was dirty and stall was too small for a hotel. ... Pizza Hut has a bigger washroom than yours . Definitely not coming back here anymore . Shall never recommend anyone to come here either .;10;
Its a beautiful restaurant good food and good view;30;
quantity was there .. but lacked quality somewhat. nothing spectacular or exceptional to make it a stand apart experience. it was nice of them to include the juice bar with the buffet & service was upto the mark too. quality of beef being served can be improved, i found it bit hard to chew. desserts section was unimaginative .. lots of different types of cupcakes .. again nothing exceptional was noted.. lacked chocolate based items or any mousse & yogurts were missing too. BIGGEST DRAWBACK WAS SERVICE STOPPING AT 3:30 pm. In context of Bangladesh, it should have been minimum 4:00 pm. & a closeby smoking section would be nice. having 2 change lifts to get to their rooftop smoking area wasn't fun.;30;
Tried buffet , average , a bit frustrating as majority items are not tasty. Good part availability of juices in buffet . Our expectation is higher , hope to see you like that , Good Luck:);30;
This was worse experience of being there at eatery restaurant. In the street food market fest there were no Chinese dim sum station. There was sushi but very limited. Bottom line is they show something and in reality they serve something else. This is one way of cheating people. Food quality is very low.;10;
foods were fantastic and MS. Cecilia Gomes (asst. manager-sales) was so cordial and showed us venue, room and swimming pool. It was a great time in Four Points by Sheraton Dhaka. I'll definitely come with my family as well as love to recommend my friends, family and colleagues to enjoy excellent service of this hotel.;50;
2 elevators to go up to the restaurant?you keep waiting for the lift to go up & come down?? forget it man .. we have other choices in gulshan..;20;
Review#1 Great new food joint in Dhaka City. Refreshing and mouthwatering. My new favorite place for buffet. Review#2 Simply Great. the best sea food place in town.;50;
Very nice family place with good ambiance. Good food and better service. Will come again surely. Beverages should be included with the buffet. When you've advertised that the price mentioned is of all inclusive, then charging of VAT & others shouldn't be in place.... That doesn't bring good news to YOU. Anyway, overall I liked it and visit again to see new developments. Cheers!;50;
Staff were really friendly, everything works, loved it;50;
Most of the items were below average. Though there are many dishes, most of them don't deserve more than a bite. The advertisement is not all revealing, though it mentions Buy 1 Get 1 on Stan Chart Cards, there are particular specifications of the cards with offer, not all Standard Chartered Cards are liable to get the offer. And most importantly, though the advertisement mentions the Buffet price to be 3542 ( all inclusive), what has not been mentioned is that this excludes all beverages including water which will be charged at an exhorbitant rate plus 26.5% extra VAT and service charge on that. So those who are planning to go to the Street Food Festival, think twice.;20;
The food was horrible compared to la meridian while taking price in account. The restaurant eatery was small and had a handful to offer. I called them up to enquire about the maki rolls before going and found premade small rolls that was tasteless and looked cheep. Their continental side had few things to offer aswell. All in all dnt waste your money and time.;10;
Foods variety r very impressive. All items r premium.. They need to improve their Dessert section as they have limited selection.... Only bad side is they didnt offer me any drinking water...;40;
the Buffet on the 24th floor is pretty good. the selection is adequate. not too much or less choice. the esthetics and deco are well planned and organized. nice lighting and climate controlled. environment is joyful. I was there for press meeting of Harriken brand ambassador.;50;
Good food & ambience.Well mannered staffs.Great experience..keep it up.;50;
the one star is for the ambience and the lamb chops in the buffet. all the other items were pretty bad and they sucked. really SUCKED! To be honest its not worth tk.3500 that they are charging per person. who the hell gives papaya and tomato inside a crepe? its really sad when hotels like this provide food like baton rouge! money wasted. please hire some good chefs;10;
Food Taste and Service is very good . environment is also good.;40;
Suitable location, awesome night view!!Service not up to the mark. Food average, dessert below standard..;30;
Starwood Preferred Guest® (SPG) member offer is really appreciated. Great � Taste. Unique variety at The Eatery �;50;
Amazingly good Ambience , definitely food variation and food quality is good I would prefer to be there on n on;50;

Thanks for the service, always ready to accommodate our requests!!great decoration and atmosphere!special thanks to my 'Greek' friend Saiful!;50;
Ambiance & decor is good. The staff service was good. Food was average. Coffee was like being in a canoe - so close to water !!! However what peeved me was the staff trying to speak in English with an accent. The management and staff should know that there is no shame in speaking in Bangla to the Deshi customers. Will I be back? Probably - if someone treats me...;30;
Located at the heart of the modern part of Dhaka, just at Gulshan-2 circle. the 28-floored Doreen Tower has been modified as this hotel. Though some of its floors are being used as office spaces but completely isolated from the hotel. They have started new, some of their staffs I met have been recruited from other hotels like Westine, Amari etc. and they know well how provide service to customers. Their restaurant and food menus I experienced found very selective and well cooked. Restaurant is in 24th floor with good view of outside. Specially their restaurant lounge at 27th floor will give you a splendid beautiful overview of the city which must be liked by all to have some time there to drink, smoke or to dine with nearest ones, so don't miss it!;40;
Hospitality at its best.Also love the view.over all lovely place to spend time with family and friends;50;
Good food! Price of mineral water is way too expensive.;50;
The place looked amazing but if there were more food items it would've been better:);30;
Good place to hangout,grilled chicken,beef & vegetables were awesome .;40;
Panoramic Restaurant & Rooftop pool 🏊 is awesome & unique .;50;
the Buffet on the 24th floor is pretty good. the selection is adequate. not too much or less choice. the esthetics and deco are well planned and organized. nice lighting and climate controlled. environment is joyful.;50;
Environment was great, foods were taste and staffs were very gentleman.;50;
Best hotels in the country.nice location great hospatility;50;
They are just at preliminary stage, but I believe soon there will be some big improvement;30;
Very bad service... That's all I can say... And heavily charged.;10;
Breakfast options are not best as per the looks and standard of sereton hotels;40;
i m impressed with the environment and food ( that was delicious);40;
Wonderful place to spend some time @ Gulshan 2 area.;50;
So Nice Four Points By Sheraton Dhaka Gulshan......;40;
It's really a wonderful place where anyone get all services nd their services is better than others i really enjoyed the swimming place;40;
Whether you’re in town for work or fun, you’re in for a great stay.;50;

I will go tommorow! so lets see how it will be....;50;
One of the best buffet in town. Almost all the items are really good and I must say great service. Keep up the good work.;40;
Quality food, nice environment...space is quite small though.;50;
Excellent rooms. Fantastic view on roof top pool. The breakfast buffet was to die for.;50;
It would be undoubtedly a good property for its vertical exterior beauty and wishing to see its opening very soon. Willing to work at F&B production and that can be started from steward section and you would get me available only over this number at this moment01772691507.;50;
Crews of this hotel are very good!! Very polite and very kind with bright smile!! I love this place!!;50;
Yesterday i went there for my iftar with one of my foreign friend....as a ucb gold card member 1 iftar and buffet dinner we got complimentary.....i will never forget their hospitality .....staffs behavior is good....and their food quality and taste is excellent....;50;
On a good way to one of the best hôtel in Dhaka !! Perfect;50;

Pizza is my favorite food because it tastes and smells fabulous.i loved pizza roma ❤👌;;VERDADEIRO
I always like their pizza specially chili lime prawn and the pepperoni pizza. However was extremely disappointed with meatball spaghetti and the store don’t serve any mineral water neither they provide any house water in Dhanmondi branch that is disappointing....;;VERDADEIRO
Expanding business from Gulshan and Banani to Dhanmondi was a bad move for Pizza Roma basically cause it meant their quality being degraded. A stale pizza diavola with a hard crust and chewy dough was delivered with no sauces or chili flakes, especially when extra sauces was an added request. More than annoying, bad pizzas are just disappointing specifically considering Pizza Roma is the pizzeria we've all come to love.;10;
"the worst Pizza I ever ate :( we order the meatball pizza 12"" there is total 17balls in pizza (small size)which was fully testless.poor amount of cheese.the pizza was properly not sizzling with salt.the test was like as, ""a pizza which is made with brinjal or Eggplants fully dull in test....!!!""";;FALSO
I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Absolutely horrible. It was dry, bland and tasted microwaved. After coming home i got sick. My partner ordered a beef panini which was Okay at best. Neither justified their price.;10;
Love their pizzas but the variation is very limited.;40;
Excellent pizza!! :) but be careful not too order too late the quality isn't as good as earlier in the day. :) but still probably the best thin crust pizza in dhaka sorry bella Italia...;50;
I recommend to order their pizza canapes when you have a party... They are amazing!!! Thanks Mark and Matteo for the great service!!;50;
Best pizza ever!!! It's fresh, delicious, light and just awesome!! And delivery took less than 15 minutes!!!;50;
I had the chance to try their pizza yesterday and they are amazing!;50;
Pls expand the menu as soon as possible...i wanna have it all..full throttle;40;
Pizza unlike any other in Bangladesh :D You guys are awesome!!!!!! Lots of love, Aziz&Naheed;50;
Great food!! LOVED IT!! And very impressed with the service!! Kudos from the Radio Shadhin team! :D;50;

There are some newspapers in our Bangladesh and their main job is create propaganda. Bangladesh Pratidin is one of them. Also as it's part of Bashundhara it's another objective is to protect its heinous deeds. They don't bother to apologize, always spread out false, defamatory news. Another disturbing fact is they have now news channel which is also propaganda house. Main objective here is to propagation of Bashundhara. A cheap editor runs the newspaper, we shouldn't expect any good from them.;10;

Dear All, I’m writing this for warning about a person who is a terror, land mafia and hypocrite in Chakaria Upazella, Cox’s Bazer. His name is Jafor Alam Chairman – chairman of Chakaria Upezala. I came to know that he is doing lobbing to be a MP Cox’s Bazer, also note that he is not much educated and his all surrounding people are not good enough. Besides he is doing Awamilig. As I respect this Politics Party due to Nation Father Banga Bandhu Sheck Mujebur Rahman, But Mr. JAf...or Alam is using name and fame of Bangladesh Awamilig which is very unfortunet for us and me. This will be very dangerous for all chakaria upezala residence because he will make more black money and make more terrorism and land mafia in chakaria. If Hines, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Mrs. Shak Hasina approve him to be a MP of Chakaria then it will be wrong decision. Please choose someone who is educated, good in politics, helpful for people and may do development work. Thanks Raj;40;

As it is introduced by kebab industries, so normally it is expected that kebab should be awesome. But the boti kabab, beef chaap are just horrible to taste!!!! The restaurant is very attractive in look, but not in food :(;10;
It is like ur home u may spend as much as u desire. And can have a different sort of testy foods....those are not common in other restaurants...;50;
I had a set meal once... Rice n vegetable were good but the fried chicken was a real bad experience for me;30;
It was our best friend's birthday... when she was cutting her cake, they played a birthday song for her...!! ^_^ It was really very surprising to her and we were so happy to celebrate her birthday in Kebab Industrie..!! :) Btw that Pizza and Salad were awesome!! :D;50;
Food - good.(not better than other restaurant) Price- okey. Environment- i don't like it very much because the arrangements of seats is not good);40;
Food quality are very poor but service is not bad.;40;
food is delicious and reasonable I really like it. specially #torobari kabab really good :).�;40;
Food quality is too much bad...I dubt about staff service knowledge....;10;
"Alhamdulillah, the food was great! Wish you all the best; ameen.";50;
Khub e baje gondho fried chicken e.......... Totally waste of time, money & stomach............;10;
Price quality is high bt food quality too low . After eating i think i bite my money;10;
Pizzas are just awesome. Turkish Kebab. wow. Love their Lemonade also. Nice environment friendly service!;50;
They should learn how to do grill.they just fry the chicken and sell it as grill chicken..I don't want to come back to this place ever again;10;
Amount of food is too short though the price is less.but;20;
Food quality is very much poor.....just waste of money & time....;20;
Foods are Less quantity. And food price is too high;20;
Low in quantity, poor service, average taste..overall...... (y);30;
Nice place with good food;40;

I really liked the environment, decorations were really gd we, frndz really enjoyed our time there. the soup was really gd, so did the pasta bt I think the spaghetti was so so. bt over all we enjoyed our time...;;VERDADEIRO
Have to wait more than 30 min to go the actual open roof area. They have only 5/6 table there. 3:1 food platter can easily be consumed by 4 persons but cooking quality was not great. Thai soup & chicken sizzling was too sweet, fish curry seemed to be fried in used oil (there was burnt oil flavor);30;
awesome place to have food with frnz & family. nice decoration. Food quality was good too.. 😊;;VERDADEIRO
Very beautiful place.... Nicely decorated, food taste is good, and service is quite OK...... If u want to go a place with green magic in Dhaka.... Thn of course it's a right choice.;50;

Nothing is good about this restaurant..😠 bad food worse service and there has not been any smoking zone Chela maye open e Bose smoking krce..I think parents nea emn environment e jaur kono way nai😡😡and their service person were more bg their actual work.. price is very much high but service is not good food test below average..so I'm not their satisfied customer.;10;
So beautiful and great hospitality 😊;;VERDADEIRO
The environment and decoration is beautiful but they have to be more professional. We had to wait long time for orders or any requests. The main thing foods are overpriced and average. Every items we ordered were too much salty.;30;
Very nice & wonderful place but foods are not teasty.;;VERDADEIRO
"Place and decoration is good but they have to be more professional in terms of behavior with customers. We booked the place for 4-8 pm but ask for floor charge after the party that they didnt mentioned before. Behavior of the owner was like ""Gulisthaner Rickshawala"" seems we occupied the place for free. The food quality was worst as well. They remind me the old proverb "" চক চক করলেই সোনা হয়না """;10;
nice place to hangout with love one;;VERDADEIRO
ill behaviour..May be the manager came from uneducated background or don’t know how to behave with customers...Open/Roof top area actually smoking area..I was not able to have a seat there bcz a group of ppl were smoking....And they don’t bother...Food quality nothing special...;10;
place joss👌bt food wasn't testy👎& overprice also😑;;VERDADEIRO

just wow... we just love it.. thay are well behaved as aslo..;;VERDADEIRO
If there was an option for 0 star i would have chosen that because this restaurant doesn’t even deserve any STAR!Worst food along with the WORST service! Their food tasted like a shit!Literally tasteless food which took more than 40 minutes to arrive!The price of their food was over priced which didn’t meet the required taste!Not even close!!! **The most worst part of this restaurant is their service!I would rate it -1 The waiters were too much rude! They behaved very rudely!...;10;
Good....and best.i like it;;VERDADEIRO

Awesome place as well as food;50;
I went there in January and there were no coffee or juice. I was told that coffee will be available from February 2 or 4th as they need to fix their machine. Recently I went there on March 9th and found out that they need more time to fix their machine. So, I could not get anything other than coke or sprites. They have a limited menu and sadly not all the foods were available on that menu. Chicken a-la-kiev that I ordered was bland and raw smell was coming from the chicken.But their environment and service was quite good, I have to give them that.;20;
Foods and environment just wow! But they need to appoint some professional waiters. I noticed that maximum waiters don't care about the gents customer when they get ladies customer. So, I think the restaurant authority should strongly handle that matter.;40;
just a disgusting place.the r flying on the sky because of the paid reviews.we r nt going that bloody bull shit place again. they r nt professional.the owner start a rooftop on his ownbuilding.they are just disgusting.n also they agru with the client.they invite for 13th feb to me personally bt after waiting 3 hr 40 min for a table.ehen my serial came themanager said tjeyve reservation over that table from 14 days earlier n the people who reserved they r the owners friend. al...;10;
the best food @ a very reasonable price. a great place to hangout.;50;
Just loved the ambience...me with my wife and da rooftop...what else could be better than this :) food quality is also good and the thai thick soup is a must try item :) I would humbly request them to increase their pasta item as the baked pasta is not worthy with its price :);50;
worst food i ever had!!bhv of waiters r polite engh bt slow in serving things like we had pizza..we had to ask for every single thing sauce salt or chilli everythng;30;

Perfect place for hangout. I went there with some of friends, everyone enjoyed their hospitality. Especially, their burgers were awesome! I highly recommend it to everyone to go there.;;VERDADEIRO

It was very tasty,i enjoy there burger...;;VERDADEIRO
"For a establishment such as this you do really get the best ""bun for the buck"" (pun intended), very friendly and I always call ahead to order pick up and not once have they messed up the order. If you are in the neighborhood give this cafe's burgers a tr,y they are really good and the fries with their signature sauce is no joke also. Happy feasting.";50;
Very bad quality maintenance Taste: 3.5/10;;VERDADEIRO
My favourite burger shop is cafe login. I have tasted chicken cheese burger, bbq super cheesy chicken burger and masala french fry here and all the items were really delicious. I dn know why this place is so underrated. Every burger lover should visit the place.;50;

The food of this place is very tasty. you can feel that you are sitting at a 5 star hotel but getting a food from a sea beach or may be a foreign country. I suggest you to go there with your loved ones and family .Have a happy time. best of luck;50;
BBQ super cheesy chicken burger😘😘😘😘 OMG that was too Yum..;40;
If you can't afford the offer, why bother giving it ? Yesterday some of my mates found your burger finished before 10:00PM. Today, I found your restaurant closed at 12:30 PM. & You people are saying it is closed due to technical issue. Stop bullshitting us. You just want to serve less customers in the offer price.;10;
The burger was one the best burger I have ever tasted, though it took some time more to serve the food Those guys want to spend more time in any restaurant with their friends,cafe login will be better for them.;50;
i think the salt level is a little much on the burger you can sure make it less;;VERDADEIRO

আমি ক্যাফে লগইন এর রেগুলার কাস্টোমার। গত 6 মাসে কমপক্ষে 30 বার গিয়েছি। তাদের মান ক্রোমান্বয়ে খারাপের দিকে যাচ্ছে। গতকাল সন্ধ্যায় অসুস্থ্য বোনকে নিয়ে গিয়েছিলাম। স্মোকি চিকেন চিজ বার্গার অর্ডার করি এবং বলে দেয়া হয় যাতে স্পাইস রেগুলার হয়। 2 মিনিট পরেই বার্গার হাজির হয় কিন্তু বার্গারের আপাদমস্তক ঠান্ডা। মনে হচ্ছে যেন ঘন্টা খানেক আগে করে রাখা। বার্গারের বানটাও শক্ত। কামড় দিয়ে বুঝতে পারলাম তাদের মেনুর স্পাইস অপশনের সর্বোচ্চটাই দিয়েছেন। সুস্থ অবস্থায়ই নাক মুখ চোখ সব থেকে একসাথে পানি ঝরছিল। অসুস্থ্য বোনতো আধ টুকু বার্গার ও খেতে পারেনি ঝালের জন্য। কিন্তু আমার অর্ডার ছিল রেগুলার এবং বলাও হয়েছিল স্পাইস যত কম সম্ভব দিতে। পরে বুঝতে পারলাম তারা আমাদের অর্ডার নেয়ার পর আগে করে রাখা কোনও এক্সট্রা স্পাইসি চিকেন চিজ বার্গারে জাস্ট বারবিকিউ সস দিয়ে আমাদের দিয়ে দিয়েছেন। নাহলে 2 মিনিট আগে বানানো বার্গার আর যাই হোক ঠান্ডা হওয়ার কথা না। খুবই হতাশাজনক।;20;

হয়তো আমার ভাগ্য খারাপ।গত কয়েকদিন ধরে ফুড পাইজে পেইজে পজিটিভ রিভিউ দেখে গেলাম কিন্তু হতাশ হলাম কারন বার্গারের পেটি ছিল পোড়া আর আমি ২ বার করে বলেছিলাম স্পাইসি ফ্লেভার দিতে কিন্তু দেয়নি। আমি তাদেরকে পোড়া পেটি দেখিয়েছিলাম তারা তাদের দোষ স্বীকার করে নিয়েছে এজন্য ধন্যবাদ কিন্তু তাদের উচিৎ ছিল আমাকে অল্টারনেটিভ কিছু অফার করা কিন্তু তারা তা করেনি, তাদের উদ্দেশ্যে আমি বলতে চাই ভাই আমি টাকা দিয়ে খেয়েছি এক টাকাও কম দেইনি তাইবলেতো আপনাদের ভুল আমার উপর কেনো চাপিয়ে দিবেন? যাইহোক আপনারা দোষ স্বীকার করেছেন বলে ৩ ষ্টার দিয়েছি তা নাহলে ২ ষ্টার দিতাম, ধন্যবাদ।;30;
যেমন ফুড তেমনি ব্যাবহার।ভালইবাইসা ফেলছি। হোপ অনেক দূর এগিয়ে যাবেন। শুভকামনা রইল;50;
আমি বিফ চিজ বার্গার অর্ডার দিয়েছিলাম আজকে,বিফ চিজ বার্গার ই দিয়েছিল কিন্তু বিফ প্যাটি টা কাচা ছিল ভালো করে সিদ্ধ করা হয় নি,তাই এক কামর খাওয়ার পর আর খাই নি রেখে চলে আসি।আমার সবার কাছে এইটাই অনুরোধ খাওয়ার আগে চেক করে নিবেন,আমি আর যাব না এই ফালতু ক্যাফে লগিন/চগিন এ।;10;
অনেক টেস্টি খাবার।দামও রিজনেবেল। অফারটা জোস ছিল।বসার জায়গা ছোট বাট ব্যাবহার অনেক ভাল ওদের।;50;

delivery on time but food was totally tasteless.. deshi style curry was provided with chinese fried rice.. prawn fry was burned.. waste of money..;10;
I could have rated it five star. I think the food is fantastic I know since have been to Green Veil. But the thing is your some photos do not have captions and you made on mistake with the spellings as 'France fry', well there is no food in the world called that. You should also increase the number of dishes and other courses of the day. You should improve your package compositions and that's it just 'Best of luck!;40;
Just love their service....food taste just awesome.... I just ordered and within half and hour food comes on my doorstep... Thanks green veil..;50;
Yesterday i was ordered food for home delivery. The amount of food is good for one person. But disappointing about the quality and the taste of food is nt so good. For me i will give them 3.;30;

"The environment was so good & I found comfort to sit there.The taste of the foods,especially ""The Italian Foods"" were very tasty.😊😊😊";;VERDADEIRO
We ordered pizza and doi bora, which was very tasty and the price of was reasonable. Doi bora was 120 per plate and pizza was 320 taka. However, please be careful about the bill amount and always check your total bill. They tried to take 2925 from us, whereas the bill amount was 2495 taka. We somehow understood that, and then the manager or the service boy didn't apologise for that. They even waste half an hour by defending themselves. Ridiculous!;10;
The food was absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation, very pleasing.. Especially enjoyed butterscotch milk shake..Service was awesome.. will be back definitely..;;VERDADEIRO
Food is okay but price is relatively high compared to the quantity served. Nice and spacious place to relax. Juices that you make are just too sweet (sugar bomb) and mask the real taste. Service was good.;30;
Good looking environment with big space,,,the food was so testy specialy pizza & juice (Mango delight).. Service is good.. After all ,we spend some good moments.......;;VERDADEIRO

Food quality & taste doesn't match the price. Worse taste in higher price. Run from counter-to-counter and pay in 5 places for a single meal. Air-conditioning is very poor.;;FALSO

Biriyani Boys served the worst kacchi biriyani. Juice n Juice served the worst kiwi juice, green mango juice and lemon juice. Spring roll was not bad. Water and Coke were the best.;10;

Only thing good about this place is the environment and sitting area. Das it. You get the 2 stars for that. Food is plain and bland. Hope to see improvements to your services.;20;
High price, low quality, very poor and lengthy service, you won't get drinks but your food will be finish as counter is different and most of the time there is nobody in the counter for taking order or even giving delivery. 3 times had to ask in 3 counter who will take order then someone came, they were watching that people are waiting to give order but nobody came by themselves. Same for delivery, said it will take 5 mins but even after 15 minutes no sign of food, then found food is at their counter and again nobody is there. Not recommended at all.;;FALSO
"#justThai have the worst wonthon :( and Pad thai Noodles sauce taste was Yaaky! with bashi fish or chiken :'( And #Juice n Juice served colored water no flavour of Mango :( and got 'Bashi' Cake from BAKERY ISLAND..With a toon cream :""(..overall, Worst food quality !!!

test are very good.. price is reasonable.. bt interior could be more attractive..;;VERDADEIRO
I strongly suggest people not to get parcel from here. I got two tandoori chicken biriyani and they provided with a leg piece and half of a breast piece & the rice was of so bad smell & trust me i just through out those into trash bin #avoidjafran #justavoidditchers;10;
Great food ..............;;VERDADEIRO
Just ordered chicken tikka and Reshmi kebab along with Tandori chicken as snacks for guests..it was a little embarrassing that the guest pointed out the masala on the chicken tikka kebabs didn’t cook well and tasted powderish inside the mouth literally gave a sandy feel....this was my first time order, hope to improve the next time...�;30;
Jafran is owned by few of my students. The restaurant has become the favorite for many of us to order from, at meetings held at the NSU Department of Law. Not only do I appreciate the initiative that you have taken at such a young age, but I also must mention that, not once have our orders disappointed us. You are absolutely fantastic and I wish the very best for you, always :);50;
Worst delivery system ever... if you want to order lunch make sure u want it during breakfast. They do a lot of promotion but don’t have the operation to back it up ...;10;
"Poor delivery n customer service :) it's been almost 1.30 hour but still i didn't get my order. When i called after 40 mints they said already on the way u will get it within 5 mnts. But after 1.30 hour i called them again and the reply was ""apnar eccha hoile apni cancel kore den deri hobe erokom "" :)";10;
When I want to take food at a cheap rate I must go jafran restaurant... Their food quality is so good and quantity is enough. You can go and try.;50;
Nice food !! Quantity is good as per the price !! Really loved ur kababs and beef achari!! If I crave for kababs again I will visit ur place surely !!!;40;
Had a dinner with bhai-brothers from NSU today at Jafran.. 30+ people , but they served every single person pretty well. Afgan dish was so delicious , Quality & quantity both was perfect. Thanks to Jafran Family;50;

afgani biriyani was good.. tikka masala was also good bt quantity is very low. And they should add any ruti (Nan/ porota) with this menu.;40;
৬ মাসের ব্যবধানে টপ টু বটম এমন ডাউনগ্রেডের কারণ ঠিক বোধগম্য নয়। গেল বছর নিয়ত যাতায়াতে ফেভারিট মেন্যু হয়ে ওঠা আফগান বিরিয়ানীর স্বাদ নিতে গিয়ে আজ যা পেলাম তা একদমই অনাকাঙ্ক্ষিত। সুস্বাদু মেন্যুটি তৈরিতে বাসমতি চাল ব্যবহৃত হয় বলেই জানতাম। আজকে যেটা নিতান্ত সাধারণ আর পুরোনো চালের সংমিশ্রণের চেয়ে বেশি কিছু লাগেনি। চিকেনেরও একই দশা। আর অতিরিক্ত মার্কেটিংয়ের কবলেই কিনা, পরিমাণটাও লাগলো কম। সাথের তিনজন বন্ধুরও অভিন্ন মতামত। তাই আশা করছি বিষয়টি নিয়ে কর্তৃপক্ষ অবশ্যই ভেবে দেখবে। অন্ততপ...ক্ষে আপনাদের পুরোনো কাস্টমারদের কাছে যদি নিজেদের সুনামটা অক্ষুণ্ন রাখতে চান। আর পেপসির লেবেলের কাপে কোকাকোলা প্রোভাইড করাটা অবশ্যই বড় দোষ নয়, তবে প্রফেশনালিসমের অভাবটা কিন্তু ক্লিয়ার।;10;

Good restaurant in Dhaka city ....my friends who are living at bashundhara r/a , will go there at least... 1....;50;
No word to say.Jst wow. good.biriyani is too good and service also ����;50;
most of the time I go there nd usually taste tandoori chicken biriani.I found it too much delicious and believe that it's one of the best biriani in Basundhara R/A.so,any one can try it without any hesitation.;50;
You can not get a huge quantity biriyani with a little cost.........;50;
Love their chicken tandoori biriani and Hyderabadi biriani . For the price I don't think it can get better than. I will highly recommend to tryout this place!!!;50;
The beef dishes are pretty good. Chicken is pretty alright too. The bhortas are the best stuff on the menu. Excellent.;40;
The Tandoori Chicken Biriyani was too good, each & everyone loved the food! I would like to Thanks you guys for saving my reputation & for nice hospitality! I am satisfied! =D;50;
Service holders are very good and always do very good behavior...And all of the foods are so yummy... Just love it... I recommend everyone to take a look there...;50;
Hydarabadi matun biryni..... wsam..... nice food...I coming..jafran;50;
great biryani......................just love it...... :-);50;
A good lunch place for office people in basundhara ! Whenever I called them for home delivery, they delivered the food less than in twenty minutes.;40;
Taste yummyyy.. that firnee is awssome.. price worthy foods.. tea/coffe should be organised.. other wise its perfect��;40;
Taste is as usual. Nothing different. Need to improve the quality.;20;
The food was good enough. biriyanis tasted quite near delicious. taste - 9/10 But service!!!!! OMFG!!!!! I have never felt so miserable. went there with some of my friends and a elder brother. They treated us like SHIT. let me give you an example. we had to wait for 10 minutes for a bowl of daal only. they kept forgetting the orders. 1st of all they gave us only 3 glasses. But we were 7/8 sitting in the table. when we asked for more glass they gave us dirty glasses and that also after waiting for 5 minutes. And when we asked for the manager they didn't even pay any attention. Even though we were sitting just before the cash counter. If you want to have tasty biriyani and want to feel helpless. you are most welcome.;10;
jst Awesome! Osthir biriyani ^_^ I jst love it � Firni is the soo much yumm..! Again jabo!;50;
please add the option of a cup of tea at breakfast and afternoon till night. make sure it tastes like star kabab or hirajheel or something even better. that cup of tea would complete my cravings to have breakfast here.. thank you;40;
Beef akhni was horrible ... totally waste of money :(;10;
Good for those who live in bashundhoray R/A. Fast delivery, fresh, hot and also tastes good. Keep it up guys;40;
Tandoori biryani is awesome...chicken makhani also good..;50;
Tandoori & afgani biriyani duitai onk moja lagse�☺️�;50;
The food tasted amazing and the portions were huge for the small price tag, the afghani biryani and the tandoori biryani is a must try! 10/10;50;
Place is quite beautiful but the service is not satisfactory . Food price and taste is good. The main thing is the quantity is great. One dish is enough for two.;30;
I took afgani chicken biriani,the taste was average chicken was just like boiled chicken without any spices.I couldn't eat so I took parcel and then when I open it at home there was no chicken they didn't gave me the chicken.Bad experience totally.;10;
Actually nothing better & cheaper around. Ok for occasional hangout.;30;
Quality food with good interior. Keep up the good service. �;50;
The food was too good.....Really loved it..!!� �;50;
Afgani chicken biryani is awesome... beef kalo bhuna is also good...;50;
Served me regular 50 tk worth beef tehari as akhni biriani for 160 tk,when I complained about it they told me it is indian akhni!! blah blah blah,they have no idea about what chittagongian akhni biriyani is.I bet their mezbani items are fake regular beef items too.Now I feel scammed,So if you want to taste traditional chittagongian beef menus never ever think about it,it is only ok for having your regular meal.;10;
amazing place with fantastic taste of foods. #Chatgaya_Sera;50;
biriyani was too good....really loved it....will come again ☺;50;
Nice interior and decoration...Also the taste is quite good comparing with the price!;40;
it's was mind blowing love it..........;50;
One of the tasty foods place. I love the tandoori Biriyani. Best in Dhaka.;50;
Loved the Afghani chicken biryani.. ^_^ quantity was enough.. (Y) will come again... :D;50;
Food is tasty, so as the Quality service, price, sitting area and cafe location...;50;
The Beef Akni Biriyani was Great! Definitely gonna taste it again and again!;50;
Very first restaurant that hasn't disappointed me with any single item! I can't say this is the best restaurant, but I must say each of the items has been prepared with proper attention! :);40;
Really we enjoyed very much. Foods are very testy tough some hot, but overall nice especially complementery item coconut ice cream .;20;
Quality of food - 3/5 Presentation - 4/5 Authenticity/Originality of food (Srilankan Cuisine) - 2/5 Taste - 2/5 (used to be better) Price (value for food) - 1/5... Environment - 3/5 Staff - 4/5 Overall - 2.5-3/5 Food we(4) ate on 20.1.2017. Kottu Roti - very good Yellow Rice - averate Chicken red curry - not near to srilankan style cyrry which i had at srilanka. It was more like Bangla style. Beef Nugamba or something (cant remember the name) - same as chicken curry. Although a bit different but doesn't have any srilankan touch. Moju - very good. The food was really good when I went there on the 1st month of their opening.;30;
Very nice environment. Good to be home!!!;;VERDADEIRO
For the 1st time I test Sri Lankan food and this is amazing experience. Coconut Toffee is just like haven and the smell of Butter Cake , too much good. test of Lemonade is little bit different then regular Lemonade. Fiery Wings is also good. The owner welcome us with a smile and ask abut the quality and the test of the food. and he is concern about our comfort. The staff is so well behaved ... Overall i like this place;50;
Peaceful ambience. Food is tasty and has great quantity. Totally will go again.;50;
That was the first time for all of us. We were 3 in numbers. As heard before, we went there in quest for a bit spicy food. And they stood perfectly up to our expectations. The ambiance totally goes with the Sri Lankan theme. It was very homely and cozy. We had a great meal. Last, but not the least, the icing of the cake was.. the complimentary ice creams. I wish Taste of Lanka the very Best Wishes.;40;
"A real, ""authentic"" taste of Lanka. Though a bit expensive, but no compromise with taste and quality. Grilled Prawn, Devilled Chicken and Coconut Ice Cream was best! Devilled Fish was unavailable but I bet it would be the better dish if they have it available. I would like to taste the Giant Crab next time.";50;
Food was a bit spicy but we liked the taste and the service.. good environment to hangout with fnf � And lastly we loved the complimentary coconut ice cream ��;40;
A neat place with good food. The chilli crab is one of my favourite along with deviled chicken & hoppers. Crab items are often out stock though. Also the place is a little pricey & there is room for improvement in service.;40;
I had the new year platter. The food was really good. But i hope you guys work on the quantity to make it worth the price. Esp. on the quantity of the rice. Other than that, it was all good.;40;
The best Sri Lankan restaurant I have been to outside of Sri Lanka. And the taste....... it can't get better than that. Highly recommended!!!!;50;
This was my first time trying out Sri Lankan food, and what an amazing experience it was. The explosion of flavours in the Fiery Wings, the Negambo Beef, the Yellow Rice and the Devilled Chicken is how I would remember my first Sri Lankan meal. Keep it up!;50;
If you want authentic Sri Lankan food, nice ambiance, 5star hospitality, hygiene and a relaxed time, this place is a must visit...love you Urmi and Nalaka and all who are part of this amazing experience....;50;
The food was amazing and the staff is so well behaved! They even gave us complimentary coconut icecreams which blew our minds! Great service, definitely going back again hoping they keep it up �;40;
Really liked their ambience and food. Little spicy for some who don't like it high, but all in all good place and great food.;50;
One of the best experience I had in any restaurant. The food was exquisite. Really loved their meals. Awesome behavior of the owner and the waiters. was hoping for the best and got it.;50;
Excellent food. Would highly recommend the Devil’s Beef. It’s really something exotic and you’ll surely want to kill for it. Will definitely come back on our next trip to BD.;50;
Very yummy food. Specially their chicken wings was awesome. My son loved it. Their hospitality and behaviour is very good. Environment 10 out of 10. Everyone should try once their lamonde. It's different and outstanding. Whoever wants to try a different taste of food they must try it. It's really a good and new experience to try something different.;50;
Food are awesome & Yaammyy... a cool place to have your dinner. Last but not the least the service is 10 on 10. Everybody should go and experience the Tests of Lanka �;50;
Spicy food with a marvelous blend of flavors and spices. At the end, the complimentary coconut ice cream is just perfect. - Highly Recommended;50;
Decent place. Go here for the hoppers [egg hopper in particular], sambals, and deviled prawn/squid. Rest are hit and miss. Coconut ice cream as dessert is a definite yes.;30;
Great food, amazing hospitality. Definitely lived up to my expectations of Lankan food which I have been so lovingly fed by 'Lankan Akkis' so many times :);50;
Overpriced, average taste of bites (appetiser), tasteless main dishes (chicken & beaf), dessert blueberry ice cream was actually Igloo Blueberry Yoghurt.;10;
Good food;40;
Superb food... five star rating service... must recommend to everyone ...definitely coming back again;50;
just love the food, taste nd aroma of food must be mentionable.;50;
Great food and taste. The hoppers and crab curry was spot on.;50;
One of the best restaurants I've ever visited. The food was authentic. It was like an amazing trip to Sri Lanka from here.;40;
The food was really good ... love the yogard too, served as desert...;50;
The best coconut ice cream � Great service and great atmosphere ..;50;
Food quality and taste are very POOR, but the environment is good.;10;
Best food in the town,expectation and reality matched 10 out of 10 .;50;
Authentic taste of Srilankan food but price is very very high.;40;
Awesome food with great hospitality.. all the stuff members are very friendly and helpful.. will be coming over soon!!;50;
Nice place & the behaviour of the staffs are really cordial.;50;
Its really this page... i like this page all time... i am nice things show in my eye.... ok good....;50;
Taste is too good. Food quality is very fresh and healthy but I think the cost is too much.;50;
best food place been to and the best food i ever had <3;50;
Quality of food - 4/10 Presentation - 4/10 Taste - 5/10 Price (value for food) - 3/10 Environment - 4/10... Staff - 8/10 Overall - 5/10;30;
It is a nice place and there food is too good.I really like it.;50;

Traditional Sri Lankan food, delicious! Nice environment & clean too!;40;
Love the food! Test awesome.. enjoyed it thoroughly!;40;
thanks for excellent dishes and behavior ......;50;
mdarif;50;
This was my first time trying out Sri Lankan food with my school friends, and what an amazing experience it was. The explosion of flavours in the Nigambo Beef Curry, the yellow rice and the Beef Kottu is how I would remember my first Sri Lankan meal. I am planning to take back my family to try out some of my favourite food in Taste of Lanka next week. Keep it up!;50;
Had one of the best experiences here with friends. The owners were so hospitable and sweet and made our day so much better! And the the food was beyond amazing. This place now holds a special place in our hearts.;50;
Loved it. Authentic Srilankan food finally in Dhaka.;50;
Coconut milk ice-cream yammmmi! I fall in love on that ^_^;30;
Great food. Unnecessarily pricey for the proportions served. It's just average Sri-Lankan food. Not fine dining in any ways.;30;
The food was over priced....n the taste was not even near to my expectations.Service good;10;
3 of us attended for lunch. The decor was minimalist but clean. The waiters were pleasant but need proper training. As this is a new cuisine for most of us, we had to ask for recommendations. This was not voluntarily offered. Even after we advised them of our lack of knowledge about Sri Lankan food. The waiter appeared to suggest the most expensive dishes as opposed dishes that we'd like considering we were describing what we were in the mood for. Ordering the food was a chal...lenge. We ordered a set menu they had available as this would provide the most selection. We also ordered parathas, egg hoppers and a beef curry. The waiters did not make suggestions that we'd need to order this additional food but it was essential for a full meal. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Once it did, I admit it was tasty but most of it was very spicy. We were not aware of this. We can handle spice but we still would've appreciated the waiters making us aware of it. The staff mentioned 3/4 of our way through the meal that we had two drinks which came with the set menu that we'd ordered. Whether this was done to make us order more drinks or whether the waiters forgot....both are unattractive. The set menu was priced in a manner I would say appropriate but the curry was overpriced. It cost just under 4000tk for 3 of us and in all consideration, this was a tad over what we would've felt was appropriate. I hope the suggestions are considered thoughtfully. I enjoyed the food so we shall be back, inshallah.;30;
The food was fantastic ,too spicy,too yummy � I'll visit you again ��;50;
The food was okay... but the service was terrible... th waiter told us tht it's going to take 20 minutes, but they served th food after 50 minutes!!!! The funniest thing is that they served the starter (chicken wings) after They served the main course... ���� Another thing is that they must rethink bout the portion of the rice they serve for 2 ppl in th platter!!!;30;
Tried the set meal for two. The taste was great but the service was a little bit slow.;50;
Went to taste of lanka today.had lunch there with family.I really like their food.interior decoration,hospitality,clenness,taste of food is appreciable ! Wish them all the best!;40;
The service was very good and the food was good too. The egg hopper, the egg rotti were just perfect along with deviled squids and the negombo beef curry. The pol sambol wasn't upto the mark though. They should add some more variety coz Sri Lanka offers a variety of dishes. Suggest to add Sri Lankan Tamil variety too especially the Jaffna style preparation which is more rich in flavor. Lovely staff and good ambience too;50;
Just the perfect flavor of spice I love...Service is excellent.Food serving time is perfect. All the items we ordered were freshly prepared and warm enough.;50;
Tried their lankan platter...taste, quantity,service and environment were really good.;50;
Way too expensive foods. Environment is good but but the management should think about the menu again.;20;
Amazing experience, excellent food loved it. I think the price is bit high. Over all it was wonderful.;50;
Authentic Srilankan cuisine! Liked the food ! �;40;
very tasty and yummy food.environment is also good.Had a gr8 tym there;50;
The food as well as their service was amazing!! The waiter that attended us was very well-behaved. We ordered the 'Iftar Thali Eka'. The food came just in time before the iftar and each and every item tasted delicious and truly authentic! However they are a bit on the pricey side.;50;
Best chilli crab ever! Top notch food! Seek the advise of the staff before ordering. They'll guide you!!;50;
The grilled prawn was indeed the best on the menu-we loved your food!;50;
Loved their Grilled Prawn and the Coconut Flavored Ice Cream;50;
Very tasty authentic srilankan food. The price was worth the experience, however slight reduction in price or more combo offers such as platters will make it even better for repeat customers. This is a place I would visit again for sure!!;50;
Please don't waste your time here;10;
Very good food. Enjoyed it and planning to eat again inshallah.;50;
I have never been to Sri Lanka...but I love the food here!!! Very tasty and spicy, I loved every dishes I tried. Very nice welcoming staff and management.;50;
The food was over priced....n the taste was not even near to my expectations;20;
Quality is what I get, everytime I visit Taste of Lanka. Authentic Srilankan cuisine, served in style truly. Did not expect it to be this addictive honestly speaking. Can't seem to get enough and the management seems to be giving it their personal touch, with a lot of live and affection. A must try for all indeed;50;
Congratulations to the team behind Taste of Lanka. Wonderful new addition to the Dhaka culinary scene...;50;
Overrated. Egg hopper was too salty.service was okay.;20;
The food is out of the world. Amazing! I never new srilankan food can be so delicious. Once you have this food, you wont feel like going anywhere else. Me and my husband still talking abt it. Must go again.;50;
Way too overpriced with a very typical food type. The portion size is ridiculous. With some other foods we took an egg hopper which costs 197+10% SC +15%VAT plus and its exactly ডিম চিতই which we can get at 15 taka. We had to made ourselves satisfies by dining in at Time out just near Taste of Lanka to satisfy our tummy. The owner claimed they have to import everything from Srilanka (why a guy need to have eggs and beef from Srilanka I did not get it though) which sounded like comedy of Russel Peter to me........and I literally laughed out.....;20;
Taste of Lanka is Very Excellent in front of Illustration. Best of luck.;50;
Congratulation of Taste of Lanka.;50;
excellent food ...........I like it. most often I go to bfc. it is near our house. I feel comfortable to travel there.;;VERDADEIRO
Worlds best chicken from Dhaka 15 no,staff quater;;VERDADEIRO
Worst fried rice I ever eat. I visited to BFC on Eid day and ordered combo meal. I found it was worst fried rice i have ever eat. I shall never visit Mirpur BFC and will not encourage anyone to waste money.;10;
Best fried chicken 😊 I love BFC😘😘😘;;VERDADEIRO
Delicious as always but I dont like the current efar package. Th fried rice is tastless as always. But the fried chicken is as good as always. But a different combinations in eftar package is expected.....with burger, 1pcs chicken fry/2pcs fried wings, coleslaw , Pepsi and fench fries.... something like this was expected...;40;
Bfc means best fried chicken....it’s really best;;VERDADEIRO
I'm their regular customer..but last day I took my parcel for iftar & alas!! chicken fry was smell so bad couldn't even have this in a bite Shame of u bfc..how can u serve wrong expired food during ramadan!!??;10;
Best fried chicken in dhaka..love it so much..perfect atmosphere too and very good serving..keep it up❤❤;;VERDADEIRO
The worst service that anyone can think about. If i could i would rate it in negative. Specially your Jashim uddin avenue one.;10;
best for fried chicken ever!!!;;VERDADEIRO
its good but price is high.I ate here several times.chicken fry and nuggets are tasty.bfc is good for chickens...���;30;
Worst Chicken!! Mone hoilo Badam diye chicken banayse... Literary waste of money!!!;;FALSO
Worst customer service and behavior of employees. This place will cheat you. Dont reccomend at all.;10;
I have been going to BFC since 2002/2003. I love their chicken & super cheese burger, my friends used to fear me coz I always wanted to go BFC..haha. but last few years I am not going regular only occasionally, maybe coz there test & quality is not as before but mostly there staff behaviour is really bad sometimes. worst one was recently at there Mohammadpur outlet, I have orderd 4 pic chicken & other things, they gave me 2 Thai & 2 leg. so I asked them can I have a breast pi...c & they just rudely replied that it's there company policy that in 4 pic chicken they will give 2 leg pic & I was just socked coz first he can give a breast by changing a Thai & secondly I have going to BFC since long & was regular at Uttara Jasimuddin branch for long time & never got that kind of behaviour & most of all never heard that policy & it's been almost 15/16 years I have been going there. I will still go there maybe less & maybe not at Mohammadpur but I will go coz I still love having those chicken & just wish they would keep there quality & look after there staff.;;VERDADEIRO
"Always BFC is my first and the most favorite choice. Whenever it comes to think into my mind to eat ""ok lets go to bfc"".";50;
Khilgaon BFC's customer service is poor and the quality has degraded.;20;
Burger and Fried rice is so small quantity according to price. Fried chicken also not that tasty anymore. Not recommended!;20;
as I finished eating, my throat feel really uncomfortable.;10;
i would have given it a 4 star, but today's experience in jashim uddin was not good. the chicken was ok, but i took coleslaw and it was horrible, tasted bit rotten even it was a day old. i informed the cashier but he didn't care about it at all, his only explanation was 'mam onek complain esheche karon amra ager mayonese use kori na' bhai taile amar 60tk krno waste korala -_-;20;
Food is really good and tasty!love it.service is also good.;50;
জসীমউদ্দিন রোড ব্রাঞ্চ এ বার-বি-কিউ এর কোন আইটেম চাইলে খালি বলে এভেইলেবল নেই। সকাল দুপুর রাত যখন ই চাই সবসময় ই তাদের থাকে না। এটা একটা ফাঁকিবাজি।;20;
Best Super Cheese Burger in the town.;40;
Caution: Experience sharing for better serving. I have been with BFC's food since 2004.for me BFC chicken is the best in the town.I have visited almost all the branches in Dhaka and know many outlet managers those who are working for the last 20 years.But it is really sad to say, BFC, Mirpur 10 branch has got some problems. I have been there several times since I have shifted my residence in Mirpur. The staffs are not well mannered. I have shared some of them, incident 1: one... day they have served me wrong drinks, when i objected the waiter said, it is not possible. incident 2: sometime a portion of the total area is blocked, i requested manager, he ignored. last incident: When a half of the sweet corn are eaten i have found some parts of a steel dish washing net inside, I complained they wanted to give another but i said no.The young outlet Manager was in front of me turned around even saying sorry.I was horrified about thinking their cleaning stuff.Hope authority will frequent visit their outlets and will check hygienic food ,cooking stuff and customers feedback's.DROPBOX is the better idea.and managers should be well trained., so that other staffs can perform better.;20;
just wonderful . I love BFC.;;VERDADEIRO
I have way too many tales of bad experiences with this low graded place. Can't hate it enough. They need to be removed from this planet. CHEATS.;10;
If you ever take a parcel from BFC, never leave without checking your food. I ordered breasts and I came home to find thighs, and this happened twice, in two seperate occasions. They overcharged me for something i DID NOT order. This is unacceptable, and I expected better from the Uttara branch.;10;
i am a customer of bfc since class 9, 2011. i went to the bfc shantinagar branch and still rmember my first day of enjoying a great taste of fried chicken;50;
The foods are great.Specially the fried rice,the chicken,the soup,the pouding was great.It is a nice cleaned resturant.😍😍;50;
Worst ever fried chicken I ever ate...chicken I ordered was so smelly,...please trained employees about minimum customer services.....;10;
Akdom faltu. Service aro kharap. Akta bollay arekta serve koray.;10;

Much better than KFC..but I don't like the environment that much.. though food is awesome ..;40;
Food quality is undoubtedly very good but recently their taste is deteriorating.. Price is also so much reasonable...;40;
Awwww � taste was fabulous � And decorations was also awesome � #fried_chicken★★★;40;
Best fried chicken. I just love their Fried chicken. Others foods are avg.;40;
I can have it daily :p best chicken fry in town. :D;50;
BFC=BAD FRIED CHICKEN. bad policy bad foods one of the worst chicken fried in dhaka bt environment was ok!;10;
Best Fried Chicken in the Dhaka City. Much better than the local KFC as their quality went downhill. Grecias BFC. :D <3;50;
More than good! Excellent! U can go here. Top level food!;50;
Best and reasonable chicken in the town............;50;
এটা মোটামুটি আছে তবে এটার মান আরো বাড়াতে হবে এবং আরো বেশি ফ্রাঞ্চাইজি আরো বেশি জায়গায় দিতে হবে..;30;

Heartfelt thanks to all the members of KPR especially to Mr. A.Rahman and Mr. Khorshed Alam.;50;

Went after seeing review of their silver platter ... I was nothing but #Disappointed #Burger_Swarma had chunky meat in it which was dry and some meat chunks were hard as bone over all it was below average ... #Wings tasted below average as well had too much black paper on it ... #Nachos was average with very little meat on it .... #Pizza was the only Good thing about the platter ... Most importantly their #meyo tasted weird as it had some kind of fish oil in it ...;20;
food taste is too bad and price is high;;FALSO
Enjoyed the gold platter. Quantity was enough and taste was above average but one thing need to say that shwarma was not good enough. But browny and ice cream was so delicious but not enough for two person. Staffs' behaviour as friendly enough but the environment was not that much Porsche.;40;
nice place,food quality was good & the price is reasonable too;;VERDADEIRO
Went there last week. Ordered 2 set menu ,one small pizza,and naga pasta!!! They were mouth watering! The service,place,food are so good.;50;

Welcome drink : 10/10 . Food quality : 9/10 . Service : 8/10 . Price : 7/10 . Food taste : 9/10 .... Environment : 8/10 . Decoration : 10/10 . Behavior / Hospitality : 10/10 . রোজা মাসে কলিগদের নিয়ে একবার ইফতার করেছিলাম এখানে। আর আজ ফ্রেন্ডদের নিয়ে হ্যাং আউট। প্রতিবারই খাবার খাওয়া শেষ হবার পর এবং বিল পে করার পর তারা আমাদের প্রত্যেককে জিজ্ঞেস করেছে আমরা তাদের সার্ভিসে এবং খাবারে সন্তুষ্ট কিনা , যেটা সচরাচর অন্যান্য রেস্টুরেন্টে খুব একটা দেখা যায় না। ছোটখাট যা সাজেশন আমরা দিয়েছি বা টুকটাক ভুল শুধরে নেয়ার কথা বলেছি সেগুলো তারা মনোযোগ দিয়ে শুনেছে। তাদের আতিথেয়তা সত্যি প্রশংসা পাবার যোগ্য। সেট মেন্যুতে খাবারের পরিমান ভালো ছিল , কিন্তু দামটা তুলনামূলকভাবে একটু বেশি। But , overall , Eat n Enjoy can be suggested as one of the best places for hang out or get together .;50;
Worst place � Faltu environment � Their wetters are to much irresponsible �;10;
Food = 5 / 5 Behavior = 5 / 5 Price = 5 / 5 Ambiance = 5 / 5;50;
Pleasant environment, food quality and quantity are satisfying according to the price.;40;

I love cheese that's why I ordered grill cheese sandwich n creamy cheesy poatato dish... sry I can't remember that name correctly... My friend ordered cashew nut salad n hazelnut mocha.... literally i liked their food... I was happy that their food quantity n price of food is so balanced... their behaviour also very nice... bt I have a complain n that is why u guys are not adding ur complimentary drink in the menu book...!! Ur complementary drink is really very tasty... ��;50;
Its awsm.thr is no Wrd to describe about the yammy food �;50;
First of all their welcome drink not refreshing at all it was tangy spicy ! Cashewnut salad was way too spicy and just killed the tastebud!And I ordered cheesy fries and they gave me fries over fried on top ketchup and little amount of melted cheese and the worst part was when I asked this isn't cheesy fries they took it and came after 5 minutes saying this is how we make it? They didn't even bothered to change it rather put the same shit on my table so I just simply said it's alright take it away can't eat it ! They are basically popular for the platter but other menu aren't up to the mark.;10;
A decent place with good food at a reasonable price. Recommended..;40;
All food so yummy .. behaviour is.good �.. service quality good� .. environment nice ��;40;
We took platter gold ..It was really tasty ..In the end there was a desert with icecream .. We really liked it .;40;
You can eat here but nothing to enjoy. Poor Service. we ordered GOLD platter which came on time but the food was cold. But we were really hungry so we jumped in. we got only one chicken piece so we asked the waiter to cut into two pieces. and then everything went wrong. the waiter went with the chicken and then it never came back. after 15 mins when we aksed for the chicken the waiter looked surprise and said checking sir. and then he came back after five minutes. but to our surprise the chicken went to another table. and then when we asked again the waiter took those chicken for the that customers table and brought to us. at this moment i lost my temper and i asked;10;
Gold paltter was sooo tasty but amount of rice should be increased... :);50;

Wow! A place where people from each age group can visit! It's a very rare combination of Tasty Food, Excellent Ambiance, and Well Behaved Employees! I love their set menu E, Nachos, and Momo! The price is also effective and justified! They should keep up their good grade and surely one day they are gonna rock the food and restaurant industry! �;50;
The interior of restaurant is so good. I love this kind of designs & Colours..The food is good enough. Price is reasonable. service is Good. And Welcome drink also a good impression. Overall it's a Good Restaurant�;40;
Eat &Enjoy. Osthir restaurant. Food quality,taste, environment & service 100, 100. Camney ki, Camney ki?;50;
Nice decoration. Very good foods. Service is also good.;50;
It's an well decorated restaurant. Obviously, their quality & taste are too delicious to minimize price of foods. All stuffs are very friendly to maintain good quality of service & sequence of service.;50;
I went dere for once. but I would love to go thr again. food was good. I ordered nachos, thai soup, french fries. its really tasty.;50;
It was such a wonderful atmosphere. Loved the food. Decoration was awsm. Wonderful service. Overall loved it.;50;

Lots of variation in menu and excellent food, environment and service. Price is reasonable;40;
Without doubt my favourite restaurant. Fantastic service, attentive staff and awesome menu. The five course degustation menu is an unbelievable variety of flavours and texture. The Eat&Enjoy spring rolls............just the best!;50;
They have really good and amazing food nice interior and yes the offers are gooood too;;VERDADEIRO
Had a horrible experience. First of all they made us wait for 45mins for the food. The quantity of the food was less than we have expected. Then after paying the bill we received changes of 2 torn notes of 100 tk that were glued which we didn't notice at the first place.Thank you soo much for the horrible experience. Won't ever come back and surely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone 😑😑😑;;FALSO
My first review consisted of 5 stars but today, I am bound to revise my review & mark it with 1 star. I am incredibly annoyed with the quantity & the quality of the food items which they provided from their Dhanmondi branch. I ordered online through pathao food. I ordered their platter, R2, & it seemed to me that I paid 2500+ taka for a mere box of French fries!!! I had the same platter twice, before, but they have seemingly deteriorated the quality & lowered the quantity of ...their food items. Probably, they re-use the oil in which they fry their items. There was a distinct smell of used oil. The fish fingers were unbelievably thin & small. I just could see French fries throughout the box & the calamaries & shrimps were very few in numbers. In Ramadan too, I experienced the same thing. I had enough of Manhattan Fish Market. Never ever going back there or ordering food online from them. They literally have lost a regular customer.;10;
Fantastic. great service nice interior;;VERDADEIRO
I m really feeling sad to say that me and my friend went ur Dhanmondi branch today ... We ordered the Fish and chips (the best deal in the town) menu.... But they gave small pieces of 2 fishs... It's really so disappointing...but the good thing is that the test was good what I expected � please keep in mind that we pay money not for the food but also the good service;50;
The Manhattan Fish MARKET Bangladesh really a good place and food taste is awesome.There service was too good and every stuffs are very helpful.I will be come back next time .;;VERDADEIRO
Best seafood place in town. Awesome food and service. Special thanks to Shahriar and Shakil bhai (at dhanmondi branch). Wherever I visit the place they make me feel so special! Thanks so much! You guys rock! Will be visiting again and again! �;50;
always love ❤️ this place and their friendly behavior service 😊;;VERDADEIRO
I went to MFM on Saturday around 4:00 pm along with my Family. I ordered 4 dori special and Onion Rings and Mussels. Onion Ring was really bad and dori salad was stale and smell bad. Mussels were ok. We ordered four drinks but even after our meal is completed we did not get the drinks. My kids ordered two Gummy Bear flavour and they did get that either. Kids were extremely disappointed �;20;
its amazing place.... & food was so delicious... really love this place;;VERDADEIRO
Amazing ambiance, delicious fish & chips, luscious & unique drinks (gummy bear-Best), appetizing desserts ...great place to hang out...Love this place every time I check in.. Best of luck to Manhattan team..& keep the amazing taste preserved till infinity;50;
Poor service. Pathetic staff and manager.;;FALSO
"Yesterday's azan was at 6.46 PM. The restaurant had served tang and iced tea beforehand. After the azan, everyone around us had food, except 3 tables. I figured they'd be 4/5 mins late. But nope, we waited there till 7.05 PM and got no food, while there was a table of around 15 people who'd received their second servings by that time. One time, a waiter came to our table with food, we got really excited because we'd been somewhat fasting for an extra 15 minutes, but then the ...waiter went back because that food wasn't for our table; such a tease, innit. At around 7 PM while everyone there was eating their fish and chips and we were sitting with our glass of iced tea, they brought us some really unappetizing, complementary soup. I lost it at that point and asked why they are seating people if they can't make enough food. To which they replied ""Amra chai na kono customer mon kharap koruk."" Bro you aren't serving people food for iftar, I think that's enough for me to ""mon kharap."" So then we left the place, as soon as we get on the lift they say ""Apnader food chole ashche."" As if I'm ever going back. We went to BFC and had super wholesome fried chicken. No ragrets, but f u, The Manhattan FISH MARKET Bangladesh. There was more weird shit before this, of course. I'd asked on Facebook whether or not the restaurant takes reservations, and they'd replied that they don't have any booking system in their outlets. They said that they serve people on a ""first come, first serve"" basis so it'd be best if we show up at least 45 minutes before iftar. I called the number given on your Facebook page and website again today at around 3 pm to check if you really don't take bookings. The cellphone was switched off. So we went to the Dhanmondi outlet at 5 PM today, and they told us they couldn't seat two people because all seats were booked. I told them that whoever manages their social media doesn't know that they take bookings, and if I show up at 5 at a virtually empty restaurant that serves iftar ""first come, first get,"" then I should get a table. Then they found us a table, lol. They took our order for an iftar platter at around 6 pm. After 15 minutes or so, they came to confirm it, and their receipt had the items ""garlic mussels, water"" whereas we'd ordered fish and chips and chicken tenders. We told them that they'd taken a completely wrong order for some reason. I mean, I'd understand if they'd thought we ordered grilled fish instead of fried, but mussels???? What??? But then we got no food at all because MUSSELS KHAIBI NA TOH MANHATTAN FISH MARKET AISOS KEN";10;
The best sea food seller and passionate to serve emotionally in the region. just fell in love with their great service.;;VERDADEIRO
This was my first visit to MFM and my experience was awful. I ordered chicken mussels calamari and for drinks I ordered sunset by the bay and lemongrass cooler. The drinks were so disgusting that we both could not take the second sip of those. The drinks were smelling like cockroach and cough syrup and the chicken was smelly too. The spice in the mussels was not good at all. The only good thing was the fries. I would not recommend this place for anything. We ordered coleslaw which was not served and thank God for that. We had some issues with the bill as well. They should improve the sincerity to their customers.;10;
Nice food and good hospitality service,also delicious food.;;VERDADEIRO
Food & service is very good.just make the New place light open good luck;50;
Treating human lives as garbage and threatening them and even going as far as to beat them up without any conclusive proof and not even apologizing for it shows what kind of institution this is. Worst place;;FALSO
This place is one of the only two decent seafood restaurants in Dhaka. This one provides a greater value for money and heartier portions. Did you ask for a single saucer of dipping? They'll give you 5 different sauces and an assortment of condiments. Did you ask for the menu? They'll land a 500 page illustrated epic noble of fishes and crustaceans on your table. Don't miss out on their chowder of the day.;50;
A restaurant should always treat a guest, regardless customer or not, with integrity and respect. Not physically assault and assume illicit drug consumption with zero concrete proof. Hope upper management takes action to this.;;FALSO
It is my frist eexprience in MFM.The manhattan fish market is best... and there food quality is awsome... fried giant is best....;50;
I loved all of the food from Manhattan but its So disappointed! Extremely unprofessional! You guys should do a thorough background check before hiring druggheaded criminals as your employees! If people can't have their meals in peace outside, then why pay service charge? No waiter or manager of any company has the right to physically and mentally attack a customer like this! And please, fire all the employees who are even slightly associated with this. Its a request. I understand you guys have a global reputation, but its not more important than a person's life.;;VERDADEIRO
This was my second time visiting the restaurant after a year, and the service was even better than the last time! Loved the food and ambiance. Just the con, please do work on the lighting at the corner tables. It was bit darker for which we had to switch to the window side table. Thank you.;50;
The quality of the food is very good and the service is also good.;;VERDADEIRO
I love this place. This is the best restaurants in Bangladesh;50;
The texture and the quality of the seafood is really good #manhattanfishmarket #bukit indah;50;
I have been regular customer of MFM. But recently the cooking is degraded. The frying of fries (potato) needs special attention. The quality is so poor that one can compare this with road side stalls. Need to catch up. Capamari fries also need to be beter;30;
food & Environment was so good. i love this place.;;VERDADEIRO
Manhattan fish is the best seafood restaurants;50;
Food was delicious. best wishes.good luck;;VERDADEIRO
a must for fish & chips lovers mussels' taste is average 😅;40;
Treating human lives as garbage and threatening them and even going as far as to beat them up without any conclusive proof and not even apologizing for it shows what kind of institution this is. I would not visit this place because I don't want to fear for my life just by going out to eat. Should close down or atleast give a public apology.;;FALSO
Not too bad not great either...they have gone really sloppy with their salad...it feels like the salad guy doesn’t want it to be ordered n leaves a bad taste ok the mouth. Fish n chips r great but salmon is rubbish, dry n tastes poor. N it was very nice of them to serve my entree after I was done with my mains as in their first attempt there we’re flys in entree🙄🙄🙄. Still I think the value for money n taste I would choose this any day over fish n co.;30;
Super food fresh fish and good service;;VERDADEIRO
The food was awesome and delicious. it was a great experience, the place was nice and cool, and the stuffs were so friendly. I want to go there again and again. I think one should give it a try...;50;
Abused customer . Learn how to treat them.;;FALSO
Fish n Chips is not typically prepared internationally the way here itz done...there was a starwberry.... what the full name I forgot,iz priced good..on top of that strawberry desert.they keep a marshmellow n melt it by fire,which may look apparently a very interesting thing for many a ppl who iz not known to it..but at an international level itz very cheap using a marshmellow only. but amount is good overall;40;
good food and good service;;VERDADEIRO

though I'm not a seafood lover, but still I've become a fan of their Salmon soup. Rudolph Punch was outstanding, both to watch & taste! Best enough, among soups and punches I've tasted in recent times! <3 other foods were average. They've a very cool music sense, I must admire :);40;

How can you employ drug addicted staff who threaten customers for using the washroom? Or is it because rest room staff ra use kore yaba korar jonno, so customer use korle shomossha hoi? Pathetic.;;FALSO
Awesome foods and very efficient service indeed.!!!;50;
I love the place and also their food. Their service also upto the mark. Want to go again.;50;
Worth Trying.... A rare kind of quality fish restaurant.;40;
Yummy,very crispy & fresh food. I just loved it ��;50;
"Really shitty food. Steer clear. By imported Fish from some supermarket or such and cook it yourself; it will be better than this.";10;
I came to have their happy hour deal which says 11am-5pm everyday you can have set lunch of 450bdt. The waiter says the deal is off for Eid and from tomorrow it will be on again. I didn’t see any notification in Facebook or even in front of the restaurant updating the information that they are not offering the deal for any reason. This is surely an example of unprofessionalism.;;FALSO
5* For Rudolph punch drinks...Everyone must try..;50;

Bangladeshe The MFM jy ni but Malaysia job korsi3y;50;
.... it was my first time but i actually didn't expect the taste to be like this .... the platter was not enough ... and the presentation was absurd as if like it doesn't mark up ... it doesn't make people feel the food ... the presentation is something you guys should work on and study on ... skills of cooking need to be level up ... skill development is needed ... still you have room to level up ... good luck .........;10;
I was so dissatisfied about the taste..i took a sharing platter which was just a waste of money n time I felt.;20;
Food's are really delicious! I also like the environment.;50;
Nice environment with excellent food... will visit again!!;50;
Great ambience, fish lover's 'A Must Try' restaurant, we love enjoying every time we go like coming back for more!!;50;
There stuff behavior was too good and ambience as well.........just love their food �;50;
Without a doubt, this is my favorite place to eat �;50;
Just love it, and wish to go over and over again. food was so fresh and authentic. serving and food presentation was too good. whatever menu card looks like it's same in reality. moreover the food qty is also good as per cost. price is reasonable.... environment is good too.;50;
I am not a fish lover. In fact I eat fish almost equal to zero. But my wife somehow convinced me to come here, and rest is one of the most pleasant restaurant experience. Food was perfectly fried,presentation was excellent and quantity was well measured.I will definitely come here again.;50;
Food was okay. Price is extremely expensive with extremely low quantity. I DON'T RECOMMEND.;20;
Bland oily food with AC not working. Not my thing...;20;
I am giving them a 5star because of their fabulous food and hospitality..guys over there are so friendly..I left my MacBook at my seat they ran to me and return it back..food are so yummy.Overall I like this place. Keep this up guys.;50;
Waiting for takeaway in a full house, on a Thursday night, and all I can say is that service is still absolutely amazing. Fast cleanup, courteous hosts, efficient management of tables and not to mention the food is always great.;50;
"The smoothies and drinks arle awesome. I really liked the "" Spicy Baked Fish""";50;
Food and service was good enough. Like the environment also but there was a fly around our food( May be as a prove of formalin free fish 😀 ) Killed by electric bat. I'd like to visit once again. Good entertainment...;40;
Food - 9/10 Place - 9/10 Service - 8/10;40;
This restaurant is the first choice for me of any other res @Dhk .I just love their food.;50;
The environment and food was really good enough .. but they have to focus on their clients service .. it's important;30;
Best Seafood restaurant in Dhaka. Nice ambience and food taste was awesome. I tried their fried giant and it was a combination of crispy fish fingers, fried calamary , crunchy prawns and cherry snappers. Will visit again.;50;
Not too much tasty. It was just good. But service and behaviour was best.;30;
Loved the food and the interior.service was good as they served exactly in the time they told � A bit pricey but ok for the quality and the ambience.will love to visit again;50;
Great quality of food. Though I didn't tried fish I had chicken item, it was really very delicious.;40;
I lyk diz place .... One of da bst seafood experience I ever had in Dhaka. If u want 2 eat some tasty seafood and spend some quality tym wid ur friendz or family, it could be a gud choice i think ...;30;
Mildly decent...;40;
Food was good,specially mussel with garlic sauce,environment,service all are appreciative but I think amount of food could be more then it'll be 10 on 10.;40;
I used to be a fan of this place but now im disappointed as hell. Today went there, ordered the CALAMARI MUSSELS CHICKEN. The first thing i noticed: NO broccoli, the chicken pieces were super thin, the Alabama shake we ordered had more foam than the shake itself, even the rice was less in quantity. All in all, highly disappointing experience. When we informed the management about the mishap, they were sprouting ridiculous BS as if we customers are dumb af. Honestly, the proportions are really less than what you are actually paying for. You lost a regular customer.;10;
One word fantastic...Environment outstanding thanks Manhattan fish market...;50;
Platter is disappointing. Individual dishes are ok, but costly. They should think about cost effectiveness.;30;

A very good place for family outing. Great food with looooots of variety..;50;

I had very gud experience everytime I went dere. I jus luv dere dory fish and chips and Mussels. I tried dere salmon pasta , salmon chowder every item was delicious . Whenever I crave for fish items Manhattan fish market is my ultimate choice . During Ramadan as dere was too much crowd lyk everywhere else dey could not provide me my desired seats so dey apologised for like thousand times . They served us complimentary salmon chowder , iced tea , frozen yogurt . We went dere jus before 15mints of Iftar but dey arranged seats for us nd da way dey served was really overwhelming . I alwz luved dere dishes but from dat day um fan of dere amazing behaviour and service . �;50;
Love the place always for sea food. But plz stay connected with any food delivery apps. Coz can't come always but craving for the items.;50;
Really I just love their food and the presentation �;50;

Place,food and service is just great...hope they'll always like this...;50;
Terrible experience today! Soup was cold, on our request they took them to reheat and this time it was even colder! Terribly disappointed. Not going there again, and definitely not recommended. #NotGoingThereAgain;20;
Food was tasty :) the grilled dory is just awesome and gummy bear is amazing.I liked their food so much.;40;
Had the fish and chips, with the fried calamari as a starter. Excellent cuisine. I found the decor, ambiance, and the quality of the food and service very pleasing. I can say that it is one of the best sea food restaurant i have been to.;50;

I just love their food. Platters are perfect for one. Seafood comes with a comparatively reasonable price.;50;
Awesome place for seafood lovers. Wish to go there again and again;50;
Food is so good. Service is also excellent. Environment is also good;50;
Excellent taste, price is a little bit high but its totally worth it.;50;

Food was yummy but little bit expensive.. liked it;40;
The Drinks were not good.Food was not up to the mark. Fish & Co is better than this.;20;
I love this place. One of the best seafood experience I ever had in Dhaka. Even though a bit pricey, I loved the ambience and food. If you want to eat some tasty seafood and spend some quality time with your friends and family, it could be a good choice.;50;
I Like yuo;50;
Simply Outstanding quality, ambience and taste. What impressed me most was their behavior;50;
Had the signature fish n chips and tried different sides. Had a great celebration of my mom's birthday. Received complimentary ice-brownie from them. And the Manager, is an amazing person. Loved their hospitality.;50;
"Environment was cozy and warm reception. Food was hot and tasty. I would like to mention one name: ""Antor"" he has excellent customer service indeed. ��for him.";50;
We had a wonderful evening..the food was great..their service was great..really felt warm..overall excellent work guys!! Huge thumbs up!! Keep it up!! MAY ALLAH BLESS U !!;50;
Worst ever see food experience. I took their grilled platter priced tk 1100. Amount of food was totally unacceptable compared to the price and taste was bogus as well.;10;
It's a great place to try out good tasting sea food within 1k per persom. We had the shared fried platter and it filled 3 of us up quite well. Cost each of us around 800. The staff is hospitable and sweet.;40;
Quality & Best Food , The service was very friendly and excellent #FeelGoodInc #BestSeaFood #TheManhattanFishMarket <3;50;
Food, price and ambience are okay. Just take way too much time in delivering the food and showing up with the bill. A bit understaffed I guess.;30;
Chose the fish n chips with calamari platter - loved it! The ambience, service everything was top notch! The calamari went a tad bit soggy (just a tiny bit) but the fish, oh the fish made up for everything. And loved the ice tea so much that I had go for a refill. Definitely will try out the place again :);50;
Great food and service. Absolutely loved it. One of the service assistant was insisting to care for my freinds 8 months baby. Good on ya.. Good job guys..;50;
food is too good and also the service.. the mint drink was awesome!!!;50;
Not going back again...though, they know manner & service was pretty good..;30;
Nothing to describe more when it deserves 5* rating from my side...:);50;
Yummyyyy and testey food!!!! I just loved it!!!!!;50;
Fresh n tasty. Much better than fish n co. and others of its type - in term of taste, price and amount. Highly recommended. I am gonna visit again soon😊;50;
delicious food, presentation excellent, stuff behave good. Lemon tea fata fati...you can share 1 set menu easily. i shall go 2nd time.;50;
I am a keen foodie and experiencing joints,eatery and restaurants are my tryout hobby. But after visiting MFM I stopped going to other places for any change of taste as I am completely hooked with their mouth-watering quality food. Should get 10 in my opinion.;50;
Totally different taste ever I had. Everybody should check.;50;
This is my first time Experience . Food was excellent only for Fish lovers . and i am happy with it . Thank you.;50;
Amazing Sea food !!;50;
Tasty sea food , nice ambience and cozy place. Loved it. Just need to upgrade the fried side specially the taste of the batter.;40;
Quick service and quality of food. High recommended :);50;
Loved the service and the food is out if the world!! ��;50;
Excellent place for international standard seafood. Expensive compared to typical seafood joints but affordable compared to five star seafood eateries in town.;50;
Appetizing food, cordial servers and beautiful decor. Had a lovely dine out with family. All in all, great! Definitely recommending my friends and family.;50;
Food quality is amazing. Best seafood place in Bangladesh :);50;
I just love their food...it's worth of money.specially their any kind of soup...;50;
Best place for Sea Food...amazing environment with quality services in the town.;50;
The foods are soo delicious.... taste of grilled prawn was unreal :);50;
Best sea food restaurant in Bangladesh, food was fantastic, service sequence very good..management responsible also.. over all highly recommended, maintain international food quality & ambience... just keep it up...;50;
Food was very fantastic and excellent service Its really no one sea food in dhaka;50;
The best seafood restaurant in town. The fish & chips is best fried item;50;
My favorite Restaurant. Love everything about it. The food is brilliant too! The quality, the quantity, all are satisfactory to me. Keep it up! Will always come here whenever I'm given a choice!;50;
Best sea food in town.. their service and environment is also very good. Will definitely go there again and again.;50;
Tasty food. It's good to see they have maintained their quality.;40;
overall it was good like environment,menu,decoration etc.;30;
Quality way down . :(;20;
Excellent food with charming environment. Specially the waiters were well mannered and got managing ability towards the customers ... Loved the experience, will visit soon...;50;
Gummy bear! �;50;
The food was horrible & disaster!! I never ever recommend to anyone to go there.;10;
Food quality is poor.. :( & price is too high.. :\;10;
The food was good but I liked the sizzling Brownie with ice cream the most. Hoping to visit again.;40;
Good place... Good foods... Good stuffs...;50;
Horrible food. Served hard rice. Apparently there was a problem with the pressure cooker. Seriously? That's your excuse? Unacceptable;10;
Food we ordered was good... But customer service very poor;30;
Food was very testy and economy. Stuff also very friendly.;40;
Excellent food but service should be improved;40;
Food was ok... Place was dirty... Had flies swarming... Service was very slow;20;
Best sea food place in Bangladesh. The batter is airy , crunchy and the fish is tender and bursting with flavour ... not gross and greasy like fish and co. Love love loveeeee this place ... <3;50;
Food was amazing and very good quality. Hats off to a very brave attempt to serve only fish to the consumer in Dhaka city. Keep it up.��;40;
Fabulous sea food ����� I just love the food;50;
Their food is quite good but I did not like their drinks.those were not refreshing and too thin.;40;
Far better than Fish and Co. I will certainly be visiting again and more. Loved the freshness and balance of the food.;40;
I really liked ur food... it was yummy. Environment was also good... obviously i must go there again;30;
It's alright to serve food slowly, it's also alright to not be able to tend to the customers very attentively on a busy day. But members of the staff should try harder to help guest select items. I had a great meal but Dad enjoyed his less, because he wasn't advised well while ordering. On the other hand, the food is great, but there is room for improvement.;30;
Really great tastes of the fish fries also wasn't bored to eat the onion fried which aren't any typical onion rings at all.....dips are unlimited and so mouth watering in taste....last but not the least loved the crispy huge long french fries.....with a touch of perfect spices sprinkles.....which was really unbeatable by any other french fries honestly speaking....will go there AGAIN AND AGAIN....:);50;
awesome service with most fast delivery of food..i took curry as experimental cousine it was awesome..we love the interior n kitchen was so visible and clean that make us to visit again inshallah.kindly add some fresh juices in the menu as other ppl who suffer from diabetics can drink.;50;
I jst love eat here with my familier.... Difrence sea food is realy.... Yammmmmy....;50;
For the Fish lovers this is the best place in Dhaka city.;50;
বড়ই বেদনাদায়ক! আগেতো এমন ছিলনা :( দিনে দিনে ফালতু হয়ে যাচ্ছে খাবারের মান কাস্টমার সার্ভিসও আগের থেকে খারাপ নাহ্, আর যাওয়া যাবেনা;10;
Food was delicious with reasonable price, have good variety of taste & the total environment was congenial.;40;
Food was brilliant as well as the environment.. clever use of space and decoration. Overall a refreshing new experience from same old restaurant food menu's. Likely to give the restaurant many more visits in comming day's.;50;
Good sea food in town within reasonable price , love the food love the service �;50;
The food was good. And the environment is actually like a fish market. Overall good experience.;50;
Good food..... Good Environment, Good Decoration.;40;
Liked there food and we keep on going over and over .;50;
the food is amazing, I loved it. but what made me give a 5 star is their amazing service. we had problem with our fried mushroom though our bowl was almost emty and we found sone of them we're undercooked. they immediately changed the whole platter and gave us a new one, we didn't have to ask for it.;50;
The service was extremely slow yet with good food. thats why giving them 3/5;30;
Very expensive food but the quality of food is very poor. . I am pretty sure that, they cooked the food before, when customer ordered they just microwave the food;10;
One of the best Fish restaurant I have experienced in Dhaka, including Food Quality, Taste and Service. A must recommended place if you love fishe items.;50;
Food quality is poor . I was not happy at all. Everything was carelessly put on the table, menu is confusing, and the customer service is also very bad. i do not recommend this place at all.;10;
I really loved your food it was yummy specially fish and chips and also crunchy mashroom.and loved the place .Service is good.keep it up.;40;
Good.... But fried rice was not up to the mark... Fish items were excellent;30;
Awesome fish iteam..................................;50;
Food was nice, environment was clam, Bhv was very good, Next time Ins Sha Allah... ✌✌✌;50;
we celebrated my brothers birthday there...the whole team was present there ..they all were wishing him and played a birthday song.... it meant a lot to my brother...he said he felt so special... !! :D and it was his best birthday surprise..! and about the food..it was awesome..!the place and environment is so soothing...we will definitely come again.. :D :D;50;
Their dishes give totally different taste.They are very good at service & they are friendly also .If anyone wants to have different experience I recommend to take a look & see around.;40;
Excellent quality of sea food. Nice place to hang out. A very beautifully decorated restaurant. Very very friendly service. Love you guys. . :);50;
food was tasty. service was really good.;40;
A good place for fish, clams and mussel lovers. Very good in service.;50;
Small portion, lot less actual fish, noting special in taste--very very low value...;10;
Had a sudden dinner there last night....was very happy with there service & food was really yumm...wish to visit there soon again! ☺;40;
☑ Decor ☑ Ambiance ☑ Friendly & Well behaved Staff ☑ No fish smell inside the restaurant unlike fish & co ☑ Super delicious mouth licking taste... ☑ Fast serving (Got our food in 10 minutes instead of the estimated 17) Hopefully you can keep this up! Will definitely be back soon. Thanks.;50;
On my first visit, the servers made a small mistake in the order. The owner provided his business card and promised to make up for the mistake. On my next visit, my entire meal was provided free of cost. This is what SERVICE truly means. I must say I'm very impressed.;50;
Fish & co is better & food quantity also good in fish & Co ovarelly Fish & co expensive but good.;30;
I really enjoyed the food here but I was disappointed with the calamari. Half of the bowl (which was quite small in itself) was filled with fried vegetables so we basically we literally got about 6/7 pieces o calamari for a price of around 300tk. Flavour wise everything was amazing;30;
Food was not so good. Service was quite slow. Giving 2 stars because the staff was very nice.;20;
Good Hospitality and Management. And obviously tasty food.;50;
Quality doesn't go with prices;20;
we really enjoyed the food !!! service was excellent !! :D;50;
It's been great to visit the place and this kinda seafood restaurant in Dhaka.. Great food, great place!;50;
Great environment xclnt stuff , the management is superb.,food quality is awsum....price is reasonable...they have successfully maintained the international quality...hope they reach their optimum level;50;
Food was good. But their service disappointed me. We were screaming for excusing us but nobody gave a damn about it. They took more than 1 hour to serve.;20;
Everything was excellent about this place. The decoration was nice, clean and comfy. The waitstaff were helpful, attentive and prompt. Food was well cooked, perfectly spiced up and tasty. In my opinion, Manhattan is currently the best fish joint in town.;50;
Loved the food & service was wonderful...;50;
I love Manhattan Fish Market. It's really fantastic seafood;50;
What can I say? Expensive true but what they serve is beyond what you could expect from a top quality restaurant of BD.;50;
Loved the service and of course the food. The food was amazing. It was superbly tasty and can't ignore the fantastic service and hospitality by the manager Parvez here... Can't wait for the grand opening to try more of their mouth watering food. Try their fresh fish and the fried calamari... It's to die for. We were very humbly offered some complimentary drinks and dessert which tasted heavenly... Seriously just amazing ... Left really happy and our tummies full of delicious food;50;
Had an amazing evening here. I loved their happy meal offer. Ambience is excellent and I am happy with their service! they served the food quite fast and it was fresh aswel. Would love to come here again. MFM Bangladesh Seafood Restaurant;50;
Go go.....MFM Bangladesh,,, I love MFM Don't judge a book by its cover but u can tell its a good fish By its scales;50;
Great food & great environment;50;
Hope it will cater the best choice of sea food demand in Bangladesh eaters.;50;
For the first time, I have ordered two pizzas for home delivery. When they arrived, there was a terrible smell from the chicken one (Mexican Hot). Maybe it was their misplaced extra topping that made it worse as I ordered for extra cheese and not a buck-load of mushrooms. The beef one (Beef Bolognese) had no pepperoni on it. Moreover, the cheese they put felt dry & dusty and the dough felt real hard to swallow. Subpar ingredients, false advertisements ??........ maybe, maybe ... Lesson well learnt. Ramadan is definitely not an apt time to order comfort food. I consider myself simply, unlucky in this gamble.;20;
1st time visited the place.. was extremely hungry.. requested the serving boy to give us the best options as we are new here.. unfortunately he did not guide us properly.. plus they playing the music too loudly so he did not listen our drinks order properly.. when we asked to change the drink.. he was very rude.. already we requested them to low the sound.. overall a horrible experience;;FALSO
We ordered their bowl-less pasta which is quite hyped these days. We had to wait for over 30 mins and their waiters were acting like the last nabab of bengal and it was hard to get their attention but everything was compensated when the food arrived. The pasta was exquisite, well cooked pasta mixed with few pieces of chicken and sausage with a well balanced sauce and cheese, the crust was crunchy and went quite well with the cream, cheese and other bits as well. Overall the whole thing was a beautiful package of bursting tastes that will explode in your mouth. To me, the food of a restaurant has the highest priority that's why I had to give it 5 stars, if i take their service into consideration, I might have given them 0. Happy fooding all!;50;
Today I ordered a pizza nd a burger from gamblers. The taste was horrible of the burger I think they just send me a piece of chicken, a bun nd some sauce😒 Over all I hated it.. On the other hand the taste of pizza was good.. Atleast better than the burger 😪;;FALSO
Their service is poor. Waiter doesn't know which pasta is which. When we ordered a pasta first we found a hair on it and he hesitated to change it although we got a new one later.;10;
I found their pizza is better than other international pizza chain shops. But the worst thing is the building where your shop is located. In my opinion its the worst building ever. If possible switch your location to a good place. Thank you.;;VERDADEIRO
worst service I've ever seen and top of that food wasn't good too. pure waste of time and money;10;
Too bad their behaviour, Too slow & lazy as well, Worst food, Low class, Decoration not good also...;;FALSO
� Worst experience of a lifetime in Dhanmondi! Iftar platers are costly! They serve the worst pasta ever! In short, I’m done with you guys & never returning again!;10;
poor quality & tasteless food;;FALSO
Bullshit service. Absolutely hated it. They kept me waiting for more than half an hour for just one burger. They don't even talk to the customers properly and mostly they don't have any responsibility. They don't even care . Worst resturant ever.;10;
They serve in broken plates and bowels! Waste of time and money. will never go there again.;;FALSO
Bullshit service, food took 40 minutes to be served, waiters ill mannered and importantly the food was absolutely disgusting;10;
bad service... they should improve;;FALSO
If there was something below 1 star would've given that waited for more than hour but food was never served. we ordered the pasta but their oven apparently broke down however it was fine for preparing pizza for other customers . Worst service ever. REPEAT NEVER GO THERE;10;
Worst food 😤 Service o baje;;FALSO
We ordered Pizza and burger , no complaint with foods , but waiters' behaviour was too much unprofessional that it makes me to rate them 1 . They took 1 hr to surve two Pizzas instead of 25 mins and they couldn't even surve sauce within time...;10;
ordered Ramon bowl. food was good and tasty. service is good. if you plan a low budget evening snacks then go for gamblers. and yes I heard there pizza has a decent reputation in market. best wishes for Gamblers;;VERDADEIRO
Good food, Bad service. We ordeded their bowl-less pasta. Taste is very good. But we wait more than 40 minutes. Decoration was good. If i gave review on service than it will be 0.;50;

If You want something Light Food Then This is the place <3;50;
"wonderful environment loved it.. �� aj only ekta item test krsi valo lagce ;) inshallah nxt by nxt sob test hbe...";50;
service is very slow. ordered chicken nuggets and corn soup. the soup came after 20mins, it was super salty n I never had these much garlic in corn soup. as they were late so we asked them to parcel the nuggets and when we came home found out they delivered us with bbq wings. plus, the bill was miscalculated (they charged less then they supposed to) so we corrected them! a potential place with great negligence!;10;
The taste of chicken corn soup is so horrible I ever had!!!! Who eats garlic sauce with the soup... Their special pizza was very bad with too much oil. Our money was just wasted... The service is very slow and they do not give any attention to the customer...;10;
You people deserve a 5 star not only for the food but also for being this much helpful,kind and sincere � Great service! Thanks �;50;
Best Can people ever had;;VERDADEIRO
One of the best Pasta I've ever had and I've had many, trust me on this. But what I liked most waa the manner and behavior of the service people their. They are well trained and very well mannered. If they continue like this, I belive they won't become a one-time hit like so many others before them. I believe, they are a little under-manned right now. I would advice them to take care if this issue.;50;
They were very humble to every customer and their place has just awesome views. They also have a smoking zone, which is different than other places in Khilgaon. The food was up too the mark. I hope they include more options. :);50;
Place is good. But service is very poor, almost wait for 45minutes for the food and the food quality is not that good.;10;
I ate ur special sunset noddles and lassi. it was yum. and also reasonable price. but more item also neeed..;50;
love the place... n food.. they are doing good keep going with this.... ���;50;
Service is very very poor.. Almost w8 50 minutes for the food.The most imp thing is they don't write clearly food price.Its their trick .But, decorations ND taste was good.;50;

Last food experience was horrible! I was craving for chicken cashew nut salad & thus ordered this from them, along with a set menu via Hungrynaki. The cashew nut salad which they provide with their set menu is completely different from that of the individual dish. I haven't, in my whole, tasted such disgusting chicken cashew nut salad. It smells like beguni & pakora. They fry extemely thin & mini slices of chicken,(almost invisible), by covering them up with a huge amount of ...besan & flour which is responsible for this weird smell. There was abnormal thick coating in each of the chicken slices. The cashew nut salad which they provide with the set menu atleast contains capicum slices but the individual dish contains onions & cucumber only! Horrible...horrible experience. My craving was being killed by their food & I literally threw it away. They should & must stop cheating people by coating up their meat pieces with unnecessary amount of besan & flour to make them look bigger. I had the same experience with one of their beef items. The quality of their wrapped prawns has deteriorated too. There is too much of noodles & the prawns are incredibly thin & small. & the dish is too try but previously their wrapped prawns were juicy. I used to order from them a lot via Hungrynaki but the last time made me too disappointed with the quality of their dishes & have decided not to order from them anymore since you get only fried besan & flour.;10;
Taste of food is very good and also reasonable price.;;VERDADEIRO
Tried set menu platter 1 and exchaned the beef with mashroom chicken n its just delicious bt the noodles was the worst so cut 1 otherwise everything was up to the mark;40;
Yummy food with cordial and quick home delivery service.Best wishes for Hakka Kitchen.;;VERDADEIRO
Me and my wife went to Hakka Kitchen for enjoying a break. The place is nice. Neat and clean environment. Ordered a set menu and they served it in time. Though the cost seems little high for a middle class couple like us but the taste of the food was worth eating. Thanks to Hakka Kitchen...!;50;
delicious food and awesome environment.;;VERDADEIRO

Great food with excellent decoration;;VERDADEIRO
Good food, Good taste with reasonable price. Place is spacious and also neat and clean. Enjoyable interior.;50;
They focus on taste which nowadays most of the food makers forgot to even keep that concern in their head while doin business. I took platter 2 and Thai soup for 2 person. Fully satisfied with every item . The place needs to be kept in a fresh condition -for which I gave them a 4 star because the ambience were slightly odorous, probably they forgot to fresh the air that day.otherwise, good envo,well behaved waiters and comfy sitting arrangements.i like this place and I will surely pay a second visit very soon .;40;
Worst food ever I have eaten. We 3 friend went there for lunch and after the lunch it seems to us that the money, time and everything were gone waste.;10;
Food was so tasty according to price... service was good ... satisfied.;;VERDADEIRO
good food. good taste. good quantity. food were served hot. staffs behavior were also good. i'll prefer this place more than Hakka Dhaka for sure. p. s. had their platter 1 and 2 and saffron kulfi.;50;
I really loved the food and its quite reasonable. The delivery was on time as I asked accordingly. Will love to order again.;;VERDADEIRO

Environment was good that's why I hitted 4 stars out of 5. I would like to say that any one can go there as well as take your desirable food from there. Hopefully you will get good experience. Good luck for Drips cafe.(y);30;

Hello ! Im from banasree and kind of a frequent customer of baba rafi branch . Last couple of times i had a common problem in this branch. They are not willing to take order as per my choice from the given menu but i had to take the foods what they want due to their manpower or some other reason. Today also the same thing happened . There is a new menu launched Chicken quesadilla and i wanted to order but they are not taking this order as it will take time and i agreed to wait but still they wont coz its not easy for them to make ! My question is why you keep such item on menu when you are not taking the order and have to order as u want when u have a menu?? This is not common for other branch of baba rafi . I want management to look into this and take needed action on this .thanks .;20;
I did order from pathao. And The food was totally cold. It was beef fried chicken. It is the second time and last time.;;FALSO
It's good actually. The only problem i had was from a new item that i had yesterday. It was Tandoori Burger. It was too hot and spicy but was not mentioned in the description. It tasted really good, but a bit of heads up in the description would have been much better.;40;
Burger patty is very disappointingly tasteless and too much mayo that also didn't taste good. Incomplete menu;;FALSO
What’s up with your cost saving techniques? Ac out fans running, one man doing cash, preparation and serving. If you claim to be an international chain but serve like a local street shop. Literally, one guy taking 5 customers orders and the place is just crazy hot without AC. Terrible. Banasree Outlet.;10;
They have the worst food possible. the chicken fry was all raw from inside. It had clotted blood and reddish pink flesh. When asked about this to the waiters, they said it was calcium coming out of bones, not clotted blood. i request everyone not to eat at baba rafi for ur own sake. u may end up with some bad disease for consuming these awful food.;;FALSO
Ordered the kebab and was really surprised by the quantity of beef and other ingredients. i had to eat half the oily bread and then got the taste of the kebab. This is unacceptable from a food chain of this calibre. Serve your food the way it shows on the menu and dont deceive your customers.;20;
i tasted the chicken kebab and was really great!;;VERDADEIRO

One of my worst experience...... the food was damm bad,there ac wasn’t working and the place was much hot and at last it’s a very bad experience and hope never need to go there again.🤨☹️😡😠;10;
I can't tell you guys how bad the food was. So, I will just give you guys a heads up. Never, ever eat food here. Not even if your life depended on it.;10;

Worst food I have ever taken in a restaurant, I took their beef kabab rice yesterday, probably they have processed some vegetables or something else which looks like meat, but believe me it's not meat at all.;10;

খাবারের মান অসম্ভব খারাপ! আমি দেশের বাইরে খেয়েছি এবং রেগুলার গিয়ে খাই। চমৎকার টেস্ট আর ব্যাবহার তাদের! জানিনা, দেশে এই চেইন এনে তার বারোটা বাজিয়েছেন কেন। স্টাফদের ব্যাবহার খারাপ। কাস্টমারদের মনে হয় যেন ভিক্ষুক মনে করে, যাদের টাকায় আপনাদের ব্যাবসা চলছে। ভালো, খুব ভালো। মান ঠিক রেখে ব্যাবসা করতে পারেননা তো চেইনটা আনছেন কেন?;10;

love the double patty beef burger...but quys u should improve the kebab rice plz..previous rice was good...but this time i don't like it.but urs burgers r always yummy;50;
আপনাদের খাবার গুলো আমার এবং আমার বন্ধুদের কাছে খুব মজাদার লেগেছে।।।বিশেষ করে কাবাব টা।। আমি সাগর,, আমি কক্সবাজার থাকি। এটা যেহেতু একটা পর্যটন নগরী।। তাই এখানে সারা বছর পর্যটক থাকে। তাই আপনাদের কাছে আমার একটি অনুরোধ, যদি, এখানে আপনারা একটি রেস্টুরেন্ট চালু করেন।।।তাহলে (বাবা রাফি) কে সবার কাছে তুলে ধরতে পারবেন।।।ধন্যবাদ আমার লেখাটা পড়ার জন্য।।।;50;

Kebab beef সেরা ! Thier food is finger-licking good. Overloaded beef and chicken chilo. Highly recommended �;40;
Yummy and very tasty food!!! I just loved it...;50;
Poor food with poor service. Tasteless and waste of money.;10;
Menu contains literally 6 items to choose from. Overpriced. Burger sauce is bland and the after taste ruins the appetite. Chicken kebab rice was supposed to have kebab but the served dish was minced meat with buttload of oil and fat. Not edible.;20;
The foods are really good , totally worth it compared to the pricing strategy that they follow. All the foods and their presentation is up to the mark. This is the perfect place to go with friends according to me when there is a limited amount of money with u and your friends and u people want a good food.Good luck Baba Rafi for a good business future.;50;

disgusting food! yaak! ���;10;
I don't know how can i explain about this.....Today I go there thn I eat tandorii fried rice ... It was to much disgusting... nd there services also faul....;10;
I went and bought a chicken combo burger on my way back home after which once i bit into the burger i tasted no meat but only cheese and mayonnaise, I opened up the the burger and there was no chicken. Horrible service by baba rafi and this should be noted down by them to not be so careless when they call themselves the LARGEST food chain. -_-;10;
One of the most oddest I have seen ever. Poor service and quality.;10;
Bal rafi bal, baler rafi, thanda noshto food. J obostha vitore, bansree beshudin tikbina egula niya;10;
overall its ok. service better then food quality.;50;
Took a special sub with cheese and two juices in Bashundhora branch. Sub bun was so old and the meat was tasteless. And the cheese was a joke. Also the juice was a cheep syrup drink.;10;
Both bun and patty were tasteless. It didn't have any tasty ingredients. Overall, it was bland.when i am back to my home 30 minits waiting for my money change how Come like Thai baba rafi @[100004834116039:Abay Ahmed] @[100000125160751:Nawaz Khan] @[100001237533135:Rabby Khan] @[100001256493167:Shakil Alam];20;
Today i went to baba rafi and i ordered one beef berger and one kabab roll..the taste of the food was very bad..it was one of the worst berger i have ever tried. ��;20;
I had chicken burger yesterday.Taste was awful.Totally disappointed.;10;

Ordered burgers at office. Both bun and patty were tasteless. It didn't have any tasty ingredients. Overall, it was bland.;20;
Environment is good.. sitting arrangement should be increased.. Food quality is better for some items.. but the taste of Kebab Burger was below the expectations.. Overall its okay..;30;
disappointed BURGER... its not juicy, service was worst;10;
Baba rafi is better than another brand I think .bcz there has reasonable prize more tasty food 100% quality full food hospitality and best service overall SO GOOD gulshan 2 baba rafi and others .;50;
Thanks baba Rafi for give us delicious taste food.;50;

"Awful service at bdc outlet end of last week i went to boshundhora and tired chicken burger from baba rafi (withou knowing how awful it can be) while ordering i asked them how long its gonna take,said 2 minits.....i reached their 3-5mints late as best .. the burder was cold like tea stall bread 😕 ... i reached back to them asking why its cold and what they reply ""apni nite deri korsen tai thanda hoye gese (in very rude tune)"" N.B not warm and cold hard bread isnt same . i did...nt know 5mint a burger thanda hoye jay,i never ate in restaurant before 😮😮 so sorry 😑 Taste : 0/10 i never tasted such awful burger in my life price : price would be nice (130) if i had a burder instead of old bread and get some real meat. service : the counter guy was a &&&& but the other stuff was good to me but that didnt do any help as they couldnt get me a warm burger .not recommended ar ce rastar khabar valo";10;
Its awesome, everybody should try this...................!!!!!!!!!;50;
They are not excepting credit cards and no wifi. Food was good! Price was reasonable!;40;
3★ for burger....... Please try to improve food quality :);30;
I loved the burgers and pricing is so perfect for working people and students 👏👏👏;50;
I tasted their chicken sub. It's too much delicious. Keep it up.;40;
Burgers very dry. Minimal veg. No variety. Only onions and tomatoes. Bun felt like at least a week old. Patty not well cooked at all. Not recommended.;10;
খাবারের মান ভাল না :( এই খাবারের মান নিয়ে কিভাবে international kabab chain হল ?;10;
Restaurant don't except any kind of bank card. Only cash.....!!!!!!!.....;10;
Worst burger that I have ever tasted....they also serve musty food.....;10;
Good service & delicious food..;40;
Good food;50;
Great service,quality food ..overall a great experience;50;

This is the perfect place to go with friends according to me when there is a limited amount of money with u and your friends and u people want a good food.Good luck Baba Rafi for a good business future.;50;
Worse taste didnt like. You should cook your food a lil more. Rice was so hard. Most negative part is I got dead cockroach on the given plastic spoon @Bashundhara city brunch. When we show it to them they apologize and ask for another meal pack. When you serve you should have check all the packets and spoon also. Very irresponsible.;20;
disliked service and test and price................;10;

The kebab is good. Burger should be bigger in size. Ice cream is good.;30;
"5 star for Baba Rafi Bangladesh Bashundhara City Brunch. Great kabab. taste good. But the gulshan brunch, eww !! really bad kabab. How could people made that ? 2 different brunches 2 very different experience. The best items from my experience are the Kabab Roll and Kabab Rice . About burger very clearly i will say ""THIS IS NOT A BURGER PLACE"".";50;
I am totally amazed of food quality! How do the really survive with such poor quality of service?;10;
Food is amazing there ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👌;50;
Worth every penny ! and tastes good , My one and only favorite food brand in Bangladesh.;50;

Very good and tasty kebab... just wow.... service was also good....;50;
It's a good one stop place to get hygienic, testy & affordable food to enjoy with friends & family. If you once come here, may be you are getting to edict with it's food test. It makes you come here again.;50;
Really tasty and very reasonable price. Awesome combination. I just became a fan of their burger. Also good service and environment. Must visit next time.;50;

Found very bad service @Bashundhara City kids zone booth.;10;
taken rice with chicken wings , rice was just simple polao (tao totally taste, saltless), chicken was gross and without any taste. rating is actually 00 out of 10. commercial howar akta limit thaka dorkar;10;
They don't listen to your orders properly . If you request them to not add few things they'll nod but they'll add them anyway. N food now is not impressive.;10;
Faltu food, + servicing.. At Bashundhara city ....;10;
Wrost food ever. Wrost wrost wrost wrost wrost & again wrost;10;
Amr name a restaurant but ami e jani na.Biye o korlam na baba hoia gelam�;10;
Faltu khabar... Lobon kom dey kabab rice e.. Piyaj diye taste nosto kore fele....;10;
foods shld be a little juicy..... all foods are rough ..... শুকনা শুকনা লাগে ���;30;
love their Beef Burger. Juicy and tasty. It's really very good.;50;
Fantastic indonesian restaurant in dhaka,price is superbly reasonable!!!!! :-) :-);50;
went for a get together with friends during iftar in the uttara outlet. the ramadan menu of 3 chicken wings, rice and coke was very disappointing. the portion was very small. rice was less and did not had any good taste so i needed to use ''ketchup'', which i normally dont do. the wings were not ''three'' pieces. it was just one wing piece cut into three pieces. i only liked the drink... staff were good and polite, service was good, but needs more improvement in taste and please dont fool people by mentioning ''three'' pieces of chicken wings....;20;
Their quality of burger and sub and kabab rice is getting horriable day by day. Their branch In basundhara city's food quality is below poor rating.;10;
awsome annd so delicious food ��...it is very popular in bd day by day;50;
You smell the 'ghee' from the far distance and keep wondering the food/ kabob must be good here! Sorry to break the news fellas. It's all about the dirty marketing strategies. They spread layers of ghee near the exhaust pipe and beautiful aroma is all around the restaurant. But the first bite of kabob is just enough to determine how horrible and low quality food they serve. Sure the food is cheap but taste matters! Avoid this restaurant altogether!!;50;
They used to be good but now there burger is very bad;10;
Taste and quality of food is horrible. Even a tong give you more satisfaction than Babarafi.;10;
All Time we serve the fresh food- Container Kebab by Baba Rafi;50;
Burger was dry Af.. Bought a chicken and beef burger with double patty.. Way too dry � Waste of money..;10;
Nothing special. Went to the Gulshan-2 branch. Had to ask several times for the mayonnaise and ketchup.;20;
Extremely slow service. Made us wait 30 mins for one item( kebab rice). The taste was also below expectation. Extremely bland.;10;
Thank you baba rafi. I used to love beef burgers a lot. I gained weight and I was worried! After I had your burger I felt like beef is the worst thing can happen inside a bun! Wat a disgraceful taste I must say! Baba...plz kill rafi and stop your business.;10;
"Yesterday i had a ""chicken combo meal"" at bashundhara city food court. A meal with a combination such as a burger with fries & drink..��� Burger was juicy, & so damn yummy� There service was also good...good behavior. I had to stand in a queue for a 15/20 min to order this combo. Seems like it's really famous or well known...though i never heard about baba rafi. It was my first experience. Overall good experience. Looking forward to go again�";50;
taken rice with beef kebab, rice was just simple polao (tao totally taste, saltless),and kebab was really gross just gorur mangsho,without any taste. really bro? you are serving these ??;10;
food quality waaaaaaaak thu -_- . Please dont visit baba rafi;10;
Great combination: poor quality food and Worst service!! �;10;
Worst burger ever...;10;
I got a #FLY in Kebab & taste is very vile. This is totally bullshit.! If anyone wants to waste your money, only & only then can come here otherwise must kick their a*s*s. �;10;
Worst food. Rotten and unhealthy! Their Burgers are the worst. Completely dry.;10;
মানুষের গুএর কালার আর তোদের restaurant এর কালার একই;10;
This is shit.worst and low quality ever.please don't waste your money.;10;
Quality of food is very horrible. Bad smell comes from their Kebab.;10;
The quality of the food is hilarious and also the behavior of the staff.;10;

Worst Food I ever come up with. Their Beef Rice Bowl is just an perfect example of how awful a food can be.;10;
The quality of the food is hilarious and also the behaviour of the staff.;10;
Is this even food??? World largest cheat chain.wastage of money;10;
shala motherfucker;10;
I thought baba rafi had more professionalism. I can't believe how low class and unprofessional the managers are. It's a bad look! It seems the managers are friends of the owners because there's no way in hell corporate would hire some of these people. I'm not talking about their appearance, I'm talking about the way they conduct themselves! I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE BY THE MANAGER BECAUSE I COMPLAINED OF WAITING OVER 20 MINS TO PLACE AN ORDER WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME! Yeah that person has a right to place the order but my problem is BRafi didn't bring anyone up to help take orders. Apparently baba rafi doesn't care about your time. The manager was so disrespectful to me and all I want to do was get a burger!;10;
worst food i have ever taste in my life..don't waste ur time nd money on them.;10;
Absolute rubbish....awful food, worst quality ever, poor service and more importantly worst experience I ever had....;10;
Worst food chain !!!! Ato bajeh and ato kom quantity and ato price ken !!!!;10;
Worst Food ever,, not hygienic and many people say that they use Dead Chicken;10;
Their burger, kebab everything is shit! Even maybe shit will be better than their food! Gross! �;10;
Baba rafi is the worst food provider in the town..;10;
how can anyone comes up with an idea of fully yellow reausturant !! Baba rafis Yellow color reminds me of poop :3 now imagine, sitting in a poop colored reausturant and taking your favorite dish. Gross :poop:;10;
Worst burger. Because the petty of the burger was over cooked and it was just like a black mamba �. Never ever going to that container;10;
Their both quality and service are worst. And they started with 99 tk and day by day they are becoming more commercial and increasing price .;10;
এইটার মত জঘন্য খাবার আর দ্বিতীয়টা নাই!!! কেউ যদি পাছা মারা না খতে চানেন থাওলে এই বালে যাওয়ার কোনোই দরকার নাই! জাস্ট ইগনোর দিস সীট!!! -_- >_<;10;
Their food is shit. I tried their kebab rice and they used rotten cucumber there.;10;
worst food in the town , ball banai ora hudai tk gula jon a gelo . ball er baba rafi;10;
Poor quality and higher price. Please avoid this shit! Justice for #Topu.;10;
"রক্তচোষা ডাকাত। ""বাবা বার্গার"" এর দাম কেন ৩৫০ টাকা?? বাবা খাইয়া দাম নির্ধারণ কর নাকি শালা গাঞ্জাখোরের গুষ্টি??";10;
Most disgusting food. Just avoid it. One of friend found a cockroach in their burger.;10;

One word - Shitttt Roadside foods are even more hygienic and tastier than this.. Shit quality and too much high price Give ur money to some poor people rather than eating here!;10;

Don't waste your money by eating these crap.;10;

এমন খারাপ খাবার জীবনে ও খাইনি। কি সব আলতো ফালতো দোকান;10;
You smell the 'ghee' from the far distance and keep wondering the food/ kabob must be good here! Sorry to break the news fellas. It's all about the dirty marketing strategies. They spread layers of ghee near the exhaust pipe and beautiful aroma is all around the restaurant. But the first bite of kabob is just enough to determine how horrible and low quality food they serve. Sure the food is cheap but taste matters! Avoid this restaurant altogether!!;10;
Rotten meat, waiters are not well mannered. Worst service.;10;
The Food is very nasty! Foul! Service is very bad. Don't waste your money to buy this kinds of nasty food!;10;
fuck u bitch. u dickhead. naam change kore baal rafi rakh. bastards;10;
ফালতু টাকা নষ্ট করলাম .........................................................।।;10;
WORST TASTE EVER. I have got to see their food rotten . and it was so tasteless. Surely the food processing is unhealthy and dangerous for body as well;10;
Sick man .. WORST TASTE EVER. And I have found their food rotten. and it was stinky. Surely the food processing is unhealthy.;10;

The chicken burger is very delicious at this price range. But the Mountain Dew is bit pricey. Looking foreword see some new items...;50;
Tried ordering a home delivery of kebab and a kebab shop has run run out of kebab!! Then what are they selling burgers??;20;
"একেতো খাবার এক্কেরে ঠান্ডা। তার উপরে ব্যানারে যেই মাত্র ৬-৭ টা আইটেম ঝুলায় রাখছে তার ৪/৫টাই নাই! বার্গার নিছিলাম, চিকেন বার্গার। ঠিক জানি না আটার দলা ক্যামনে চিকেন হইলো! কোন টেষ্ট তো পাই নাই; উপরন্তু যেই চিজ এর জন্য বাড়তি ২০ টাকা দিছিলাম ,সেই চিজও দিতে ভুইলা গেছে। বলছিলাম পেয়াজ ছাড়া দিতে, খালি এইটাই ঠিক রাখছে; তাও ৪বার বলার পরও দিয়া দিছিলো, বইলা উঠানো লাগছে। বসুন্ধরা সিটির ব্রাঞ্চের কথা বলতেছি।";10;

liked your kebab and burgers �� just please give us a bit more mayo and latus! i went twice and got 1 half spoon of mayo and a tiny size latus :3 bt bun was fresh and the kebab was mouth watering!! thanks for keeping the best quality within a reasonable range;40;
It was very nice to have them in Bangladesh . There food was very quality full and also very tasty . Keep it up Baba Rafi .;50;
The kebab i tried for the 1st time & my experience was horrible. The whole kebab item with rice was worst.when we complained about bad rice( very dried) they only laughed but no solution..;10;
Cold drink price is so high.;10;
The chicken burger is very delicious. You must try it;40;
nice place for delicious foods... just love it �� Best wishes �;50;
I reviewed your Chicken Burger and Chicken Kebab Roll on my Food review channel ...simply awesome food (y) :);50;

The worst bueger i have ever tasted.nothing get xcept onion .no cheese .acdom faltu.;10;
Testy- 8/10 Price- 10/10 এক কথায় অসাধারণ।;50;
We had the following (opposite NSU main gate 1 & 2): 1 Beef Burger = 99 Taka. Was pretty good. Loved the buns they use. The patty was good for the price range, despite being doused with a lot of sauce. Also, it is a very messy burger so make sure you get tissues. 2 Chicken Burgers = 198 Taka. The chicken burger is definitely the best item on the menu. Delicious patty which complements the soft sesame buns. They use the same sauces for both the beef and chicken burgers. Howeve...r, the sauce combo tastes much better with the chicken patty. 1 Beef Kebab = 99 Taka. The packaging is nice, the kabab wrap is decent. It is definitely not worth getting this for 99 taka. Also, the beef kebab has star anise in it, so if you don't like the smell of star anise, stay away from it! 1 Chicken Kebab = 99 Taka. Again, the chicken version is much better than the beef version. Still not worth 99 taka IMO. The meat to veggie ratio is waaaay off. They need to put more meat in this to be worth 99 taka. Tastes pretty good though. 1 Mountain Dew = 60 Taka. Regular fountain drink glass (not the tiny ones they give you at KFC or other places). Expensive yes, however it was pretty refreshing. Tasted like proper mountain dew (not some watered down version of it). Recommendations = stick to the chicken burgers. Definitely worth it!;40;
went to Baba rafi 300 feet Bashundhara r/a they only serve 100 and 160 tk combo burger deal! One of the best burger in that price,, but i have to give points to fries,,its similar to Mcdonalds fries and Hungry Jacks i had in Australia. Beef Burger was juicy and the sauce they used was really nice with a hint of Garlic Im gonna be honest, i had most amount of burgers around dhaka from banani, malibag and mirpur, dhanmondi and 300 feet... Baba rafi beats all in price and taste and with excellent cooked fries! Top quality. Thats why i had two burgers!! N.B- every place we been to, customer service is never satisfactory, but this girl in baba rafi,,,she was kind, explainable and also served with smile where she was wearing hijab and with decency,,,5star for because she did that. Thanks for the experience. keep up the good work!;50;
Wrap খাইলাম। খুবই ভাল লাগছে। ফিতরার টাকার বদলে Take Out আশা না করাই উত্তম। তবে Taste মোটেই cheap লাগে নাই। বান্ধা customer হয়ে গেলাম।;50;
Now this is confusing . How can a shop have 68 5 stars and 34 1 stars? Some r sayin faltu, shit, rotten meat, served cold. Some are sayin they didnt find any meat in it, it was just tomato n onion or even thr service is slower than granny . N some r saying this is the best burger in town, nothing is better than this. Is it like the owner pushed his friends to give good reviews ? Or is it like those who suffered are mean enough to want others to suffer as well? Didnt try anything yet . After going through the reviews, i got confused . So.....its just a question that came into my mind.;30;
The beef kebab in kebab rice tasted raw. The rice were overcooked. I felt i wasted 100 bucks!;10;
You cheat....I took 5 burger as parcel..one of them was faulty...both side bun was lower part..;20;
Good value for money but very dry burgers. Also, I wish they had options to customize (extra patty/cheese etc.);30;
worst food,just waste of money. Very bad quality;10;
We had beef kebab wrap & for me it was a value meal.. full of freshness... 99/- worth it. Will be grabbing now and then! ��;40;
Yesterday I tried burger and sub from Bashundhara city with my friend. Both of them served cold. Only with mayo and lettuce, no cheese/tomato/onion!!! And it was cold!!!! If this is the quality from the very beginning, it will just take time to be ruined...;10;
The Food's good, I go there very often but most of the time I get cold food served!! So, you guys should improve your servings;20;
Tried there chicken & beef burger .The taste was nice and well balanced .The beef kabab wrap was okay .Overall there food was nice and the service was good �;40;
I have eaten their burger . seriously disgusting taste .;10;
Beef Burger was just plain bun and a patty with 2 slices of onion and a bit of mayo. Also the bun was cold. It should've been worth maximum 60/- and the service? S..L..O..W! -_-;20;
Awesome food in dhaka. You can try with other food.;50;
Good For the Price , people were nice too;50;
Just awesome food��liked it..wish u best of luck and keep it up..;50;
Awesome food�just loved it❤wish you baba rafi all the best�keep servicing us such a good and healthy food everyday as always...the burger and the kabab taste was excellent..good luck Baba Rafi..wish you all the best..;50;
It was just awesome��...I wish one day Baba rafi will be on fire� with their best food...excellent food it was...loved it�❤...and the kabab was just awesome��...hope I can go everyday...wish You best of luck�;50;
Not even worth 100tk and they are saying this is their promotional price... such a joke! �;20;
Faltu....����������������������;10;
Their Chicken kabab is below average you can hardly find any Chicken, their Variant Milk is a disaster, awful taste. The only thing I'll suggest is their Chicken Burger, which is decent.;20;
Tried beef burger.... Very very basic... price is way high according to its quality;10;
Tried their chiken kabab in a porota I guess.. but only tasted like salad roll .. not worth spending 99 taka..if it was 40-50 taka then it would have been considerable;20;
Fresh Healthy Food. All for Tk.99.00 You just can't beat it..;40;
একটা রুটি পেঁচিয়ে তার ভিতরে কিছু টমেটো, পেয়াজ,সস আর না খুজে পাওয়া চিকেন দিয়ে ক্যম্নে চিকেন কাবাব হইলো আল্লাহ মালুম! যে একবার খাইবো দ্বিতীয় বার তাকিয়েও দেখবোনা!;10;
Taste of chicken burger isn't good at all Price is too high -_-;10;
ভাল কিছু বলতে পারলাম না কারন সবমিলিয়ে প্রত্যেকবার তাদের সার্ভিস আমার কাছে খারাপ লেগেছে :(;20;
There Chicken and Beef Kabab was amazing, everything balanced. Their burger is just ok nothing special to it.;40;
Delighted taste in Bangladesh....Love to eat all the time....;50;
Food is ok.but service is not good at all..its my opinion.;30;
Superb Excellent;50;
I would say food is good but lack of managing skill!;40;

I have just finished their wari pasta. it was so yummy. Thank u so much for the offer of buy one get one pasta :-);;VERDADEIRO
I ordered food using Pathao app. The restaurant calls me and say that price have changed and I have to pay about 250 taka more per items that I ordered. According to them the price did not get updated even though had changed the menu price. I agreed since didn't have much time to order again. Now the rib eye steaks that I ordered cost me 850 each. I received the items on time. The meat was not at all juicy and was so hard that I started to feel fatigue and pain i n my hand to cut. I couldn't finish it neither could my father. The price is excessively high and then you get something like this. I would have walked out if I was served it in the restaurant. The only thing that was good was the mashed potato tasted good.;10;
ordered thai soup via foodpanda. too much dissapoited. such bad quality!!! I never had so bad soup in my life. its just full of cornflour nothing else.😡;;FALSO

Very good food service, we had the pasta and it was nicely seasoned with just the perfect amount of cheese. And their environment was very nice and cozy.. and spacious. I recommend this..!;40;
The Jazz Lovers platter definitely found a place in our favourite platter lists. The sauce on the steak was the cherry on the top and the whole combination definitely deserves a star. Although the Pasta khilgaon lacked a bit of flavours but the cheese and mushroom is still praiseworthy. Should definitely revisit for the platter.;40;
If u are looking for a good place to hangout in reasonable price..this is the perfect one...�� their survice and behave is very satisfying ..food is very delicious,especialy their pasta khilgaon.. environment and their music taste really is diffrent than other place...�;50;

Try their pasta...just mind blowing!� Best pasta I have ever tried...;50;
Good food, good service and live show: The restaurant took the effort to cut through the menues which are no more available. Thumbs up for that. Plus the foods are good and freshly prepared. We were satisfied with the T-Bone steak (preparation time and taste) and Chicken Wrap. My kid loved the live performance. The service was smart and polite. Most likely among the best all rounder restaurent in the Khilgaon food street. However, I have bad experience in restaurants where they were good, and became lathergik later. So, consistency will have to be checked in regular basis.;40;
it was really good experience with Tune & bite .foods are really tasty.environment is awesome. service r also good.;40;
The food was good as it appear in the picture Cheers;40;
অপেক্ষা করানো ছাড়া বাকি সব কিছুই একের 'ক' ছিল :);40;
Place was so good and the food could be better. environment is outstanding and the live music make it more enjoyable.;50;
place is good bt their service is not good. we asked them to get us 2 normal plate and what they gave us 2 small plate. And price is high but quantity? very poor. now come taste? when u dont get well service plus expected food quantity then even good food feels like bad food. Taste 8/10;10;
quantity was so less..and not enough good behaviour;10;
It's food was also delicious, Hope to want there again, spent a nice evening on last Thursday.;30;
We had the dish jazz lovers on buy one get one offer Food was excellent service and everything was good enough The staff was very humble and friendly Satisfied with their behavior and services;50;
Honestly loved it. They have wonderful offers and yeah food items are tasty af;50;
Nothing to say about it.... just awesome �;50;
Food was good. Not extraordinary. Environment was very convenient... It was the best best thing about this place... Live music was good also.;40;
Worst pasta they have Never go back there again;20;
owsome place owsome environment & owsome live music;50;
আজকে তাদের পাস্তা অফার এ গেছিলাম ৪ জন। তাদের ব্যবহার দেখলে মনে হয় যেন আমরা ফ্রি তে খেতে গেছি। White সস এর bottle প্রায় খালি ছিল। আমরা ছিলাম ৪ জন। পর পর ৩ বার চাইবার পরও ওয়েটার দিয়ে যায়নি। পরে কাউন্টারে বলার পরে দিয়ে যায়। তাদের এরকম ব্যবহার এর জন্য complain ও করেছিলাম। এর কিছুদিন আগেও তাদের পাস্তার অফার ছিল। পাস্তা lover হিসেবে যথারীতি হাজির। সেদিন তাদের AC ছিল নষ্ট। এবার আসা যাক খাবারের মানের কথায়। তাদের পাস্তা আর সেট মেন্যু ই শুধুমাত্র খেয়েছি। সেটা নিয়ে বলতে গেলে পাস্তায় চিক...েন/ বিফ খোঁজার জন্য সম্ভবত ম্যাগনেফাইং গ্লাস এর দরকার। খুব ভাগ্যবান হলে কয়েকটুকরো চিকেন খুঁজেও পেতে পারেন। আর তারা অফারের পাস্তায় চিকেন আর পাস্তা ছাড়া অন্য কোন ingredient add করেনা। আর সেট মেন্যুর কথা বলতে গেলে বলতে হয় খাবারের মানের তুলনায় দামটা একটু বেশি। কিন্তু, বাদবাকি বিষয়গুলো বাদ দেয়া গেলেও তাদের ব্যবহার এর দিকটা মোটেও বাদ দেবার মত না। খিলগাঁ এর অন্যান্য রেস্টুরেন্ট এর তুলনায় তাদের ব্যবহার জঘন্যতম।;10;
the food was yummy.. and song was superb... became seduced.. overall atmosphere was outstanding..;40;
jaazz lovers ����.. healthy yummy worth to take a shot...;50;
They doesn't know how to talk with the peoples....;10;
Very bad service. Ordered noodles, after 1.5 hours got the noodles after following up 4 times. � Noodles was full of burning smell. � I informed this in the reception. Seems lkke they dont care! Not recommended for food. The artist singing was good though. Dont go if you want to eat.;10;
Buy one get one pasta offer ����� Jazz lover ���;10;

Food is okk. But service onk khrp. I was feeling like I was in moholla's local hotel. Music khub besi high bit lagse coz akta room ar moodhe airokom high bit song valo lage na. Akta table a 2 ta family bosha khub e awkward akta feeling. Aita hotel hole mana jeto bt it's a music cafe so I think environment ta oirokom vhabei maintain kora uchit. At end I can say that it's a very disappointed place.;20;

Exactly a year ago visited you ppl gosh one of my favourite restaurants in Bangladesh. Cant wait to come and visit you guys again��;50;
Thumbs up for Pizza Volcano, french fries and for the courteous service too. But the extreme loud sound of music and the quality of singers are huge let down. It was difficult to have a normal conversation due to the loud music.;30;

A great place for pizzas :) loved their pizzas and their service!;50;
Food was good and nice place also...... thanks :);50;
NOT bad.;40;
(y);50;
This place was a bad experience. The food was bad, the cold drinks tasted like it had water in them and the bottles were dirty, there was no electricity the whole time we were there. The electricity thing might have not been totally their fault but if they are running a restaurant business then they need to make arrangement for electricity generators for this kind of situation. U can’t just have one fan. It was suffocating. Horrible place............;10;
Such a nice place along with the food. Had an great time with my friend over here.;40;
In one word...The Best... Perfect location, soothing music, enjoyable concert, yummiest food, friendly ambiance, nice deco.... Perfect departure from so called restaurant;50;
keep it up (y);10;
Not good at allzz. The services and unsafety parking facilities.;10;
poor food quality with way too high price. service is average;10;
Good food & nice place for party.;50;
wishes best of luck...............................;40;
Nice place....music is owsum...nd delicious food......;30;

They wished me and surprisingly gave me a beautiful card and cute doll. Such a great hospitality and the environment was too good. Thanks;50;

5 Star, it will obviously be good cause it is Managed by my beloved team mate Israt Ethar!!! Cheers for Her..;50;
amazing food, perfect quantity!;;VERDADEIRO
Very good ambience with great taste of food.;;VERDADEIRO
The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great but I am so sorry to say that I found hair on one of my food I was so disappointed they haven’t changed my food �;30;
Tasty foods, nice environment, good location!;;VERDADEIRO
The food was really good and tasted like I expected, the service was praiseworthy too. But the atmosphere however can get pretty noisy, probably due to the low ceiling and square rooms. I hope they can expand in the future and get a spacious place so it doesn’t feel this congested. This place has a lot of potential!;40;
An excellent place with good food. Service needs to improve. Heavily understaffed. Good arrangement of the seats as well. But the taste of they makes up for everything else.;40;
One of my favorite restaurant in Dhaka. Very peaceful environment and yummy foods.;50;
Very good. To be excellent, below are few suggestions - 1. Some kinda smell is there in the restaurant. Probably coming from kitchen. The exhaust is probably not functioning well. 2. Quantity is low in view of the price. Overall very good food, place, service.;40;
The foods were really tasty, I should agree. But, the price is way too high compared to their quantity. Quality, Ambience, Service were too good. I didn't like their sea food assorted something, that dish had small crabs mostly which was not at all tasty. Price was 870/- including the VAT, but the amount was so less.;40;
Good food, with good taste. I liked it, you guys may try, hope you gonna love it;;VERDADEIRO
Amazing ifter platter. They give you exactly what they show in the photos and all the items taste delicious �;50;
The first order Which was a salad came after 30mins.Then, Suddenly there was a blackout. I am expecting hence got really unwell in that hot atmosphere. The main course was Fried Rice Beef Bulgogi and a shrimp dish.The fried rice and Bulgogi was quite disappointing.Fried rice was not even mixed properly. Overall Very very disappointed.;;FALSO
If not for anything else I had to come to the page and write a review for the lamb itself..!! I usually never ever try lamb in restaurants but man did this blow me away� U MUST TRY THE LAMB� Overall I liked all the foods and we literally tried everything on the menu� The servers are also very polite and well-mannered.. All in all-the place maybe named 'Little Korea' but it has some big bold bang flavours waiting for u.. Will definitely come again�;50;
"Guys I'm sorry but your food tastes like Poorly cooked Indian food, might consider renaming the place to ""Little India"". I threw up after eating at Little Korea last week and I would not recommend anyone to come 5Kms within the place until you get chefs that can make decent food.";;FALSO
The food is good, service excellent. Salads and starters are tasty. Lambs are juicy but the sea food platter is insufficient. Kimchi was absent, chopsticks and crockeries are poor. Interior has to be improved a lot. The entry steps are risky, please try to reconstruct it properly.;30;
Brilliant little place. The balance of the food was just right. The grilled dishes were perfect! noob tip: have what they recommend on the menu :);50;
Food is ok but somehow couldn't bring th taste of Korean food. Can be tired but if you really want to have Korean food this is not the place.;30;
Nice environment. Expensive but good place for mild hang out or healthy dating. Food quality not bad but quantity is short in some cases. Service is very good.;40;
The service is exceptionally good. As far as their food is concerned, it is what you need from stereotype foods all around the town. Its different yet mouthwatering. They remembers you and as a complimentary gesture they gave us a main dish last night as I took my kids out there.;50;
Great food , good location , excellent service . I highly recommend this place if you're looking for tasty food and good time :);50;
The food and service was excellent! The waiters were very informative. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone also for the extra attention the owners give to their customers and their needs.;50;
Found hair in 2 of the food items and they replased both of it and gave 10% discount. But after coming home im feeling super sick and vomiting continuously. And my friends are feeling sick too Please be clean guys;10;
I just loved the place..;50;
Great ambience. Quality of the food was outstanding. Liked the new buzzing system. The service was very good. Our server, Mamun is very passionate and efficient in his duty.;50;
I like the place and food.;50;
Value for money. Great Taste. Food Amount is good. Though, its' not authenticated Korean restaurant like Suraon or Dae Jang Geum, but food taste was very close to Korean food.;50;
The food was amazing and one of the owners themselves checked up on us. It was a good place to visit and hoping to come back some time soon :);50;
Worst service ever. Been waiting for an hour after ordering food. Apparently, they ran out of beef so someone went to buy beef from the supermarket.;10;
I went there yesterday and love their Lamb chops...it was tasty and juicy. Loved it. Service is also good. One suggestion that is, try to bring with platter in the reasonable price.;50;
Credit card machine doesn’t work! I don’t know how these guys think we will always carry cash! I will never come back.;10;
Amazing food! I had the bento box which was really good and worth the value. Keep it up :);50;
Albeit the place is named 'Little Korea' but it has some real big bang korean flavours ready to serve as you roll in to dine. Will surely pay my next visit soon.;50;
Awesome food..awesome environment. I enjoyed fullest. It is one of the best restaurant I have ever visited. Highly recommending.;50;
Excellent ambiance...Food is also good...specially beef melted cheese is awesome...a must visit place all...;50;
The food was average. But enjoyed it.;30;
Their FOOD quantity is very low & Roasted Duck dish is a joke. Served very tiny portion. Which is very unfair compare to the pricing we have paid. NOT Recommended.;20;
Like the food, good service. Just gets a little too crowded and its a small place.;40;
Nice place with a good decoration convenient food And friendly service. Only one thing to complain that my girlfriend didn't get K-pop playing there ��and after asking, they didn't have any clue what kpop was ���.;40;
Excellent place for fnf and of course the foods are yummy .... we love little korea... and thankz alot for your wonderful support...;50;
The bim bim bap was great, char grilled lamb and California roll was amazing..fried dumplings were ok.;50;
Good food, good place, good service, good menu loved it;50;
The fried chicken with cheese was bomb.. everything was amazing. If i stayed in BD i would have visited more often.;50;
One of those best Korean Restaurant in town. No doubt I am visiting this place frequently. #koreanfood;40;
Loved the food. Something different and exceptional. But very difficult item on the menu to pronounce. :p;50;
Food was not good.. Compare to quantity price is high.. Will never go again..;20;
Foods were really good....loved the beef bulgogi most...planning to go again soon! ��;50;
The food and service both were good! Had something different than the usual food! Highly recommended! P.S. They open their restaurant at 6.30 pm.;50;
Good food, cozy environment and the prices are quite reasonable.;40;
Loved it. good food great Ambience.Deff coming back again! :);50;
Delicious food with nice environment. Also the staffs are cordial.;40;
In one word the best .. Keep it up;50;
Great experience!!! Must visit for Korean food lovers!!!;50;
Excellent Food coupled with good music and good atmosphere!! Loved the Charcoal Beef, and will definitely visit again!!;50;
Slightly expensive. But worth the money. Good food. Good ambience.;40;
The dish was just amazing and the ambience is good. Just felt myself be there;50;
Nice Food... Great Service. Maybe a little bit expensive.;50;
Food is awesome�. But price is but high incomparosin to quantity.;40;

Excellent food quality with Good service...;50;
ダッカでリーズナブルな韓国料理。 ビビンバは石焼ビビンパで驚いた。;50;
oneeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek josssssssss!!!;50;
We ordered assorted seafood, fried rice , chicken with dry chilli and bevarage . The quantity was good for two people . But the price was really high compared to the quantity . The fried rice was cold and the chicken was hard. Would I visit there second time ? No.;30;
"1. Awful service. No one greeted or showed us where to sit. One of the waiters failed to fetch us a bottle of water. 2. The food is at best mediocre for the price. They are charging premium price. The service and the quality of the food should really be up to the mark. I'd be happy to change this review if they manage to improve. When you say ""from the founders of Tokyo Express"", it really is hard to cut them some slack.";10;
Taste wise the food was awesome!! I would love to visit there again n again..no issues with the price! Bt the quantity gave me a bit heart attack :p Overall, loved my 1st experience with Little Korea.;50;
Service could have been much better. Seems like they are not yet ready to handle a busy crowd. Food taste was good, especially the Charcoaled sea food platter but it was not warm.;30;
Good Food and Service.The chargilled items on the menu have a nice smoky flavour running through and is very nicely seasoned. Overall had a good experience.;40;
food was 10/10 but quantity was too low that I couldn't even expect as per the price...;20;
Loved the food especially the bibimbap, nice to have affordable Korean food in an awesome location;50;
The food and the service both were brilliant. I just LOVED the beef bulgogi. Will definitely recommend it to friends and family.;50;
I'm so glad that this amazing restaurant is just a few minutes away from my home and I can drop by as many times as I want to :D Absolutely loving their Korean cuisine, particularly their chicken and beef items are just out of this world ♡♡♡♡♡♡♡;50;
Amazinggg food ♥️ Loved the service and the place all over✨ The chicken dry chilli is to die for 🍗 ♥️;50;
Loved the ambience and food is finger lickn gud.......love all the food and roast duck is a killer for tongue.;50;
Absolutely LOVING it!!! 😍;50;
Great food! Definitely worth going back for any day :);50;
Lamb is a must try. The prawn tempura needs seasoning, way too bland for my taste. Good job and best of luck.;40;
I tried the almost the whole menu ... 1/2 items were average but 14/15 other items were outstanding.. highly recommended .. best part not too pricey.. �;50;
The food were really delicious whatever we tried..awaiting to try more items..;40;
The ambience is beautiful & food is delectable. Don't leave with out trying the lamb!;50;
Awesome food...decor is tastefully done...did not find anything to complain about...lamb and the duck salad on the menu is highly recommended...keep up the good job..;50;
I just can't get over the place and the food! Best of luck Team Korea! :D;50;
Lamb is a must. Try the duck salad & beef also ...;50;
The food is OMG! Especially the lamb and the beef! U guys need a bigger space :P;50;

Great service and they are very helpful.food was awesome ❤;;VERDADEIRO

Probably I have had the best halim today from Paprika. It was just like home made halim but with amazing mouthwatering flavours. Price was also reasonable. Good luck, and Keep up the quality of the foods.;50;
Nice and tasty food, Very good service, good environment. But food qauntity should be a little more.;;VERDADEIRO
I had my iftar in Paprika yesterday.The taste of the continental iftar platter 3 was good but the food were served way too earlier (even we saw our plates arranged in the kitchen long before they were served) which eventually turned them cold..they should have served or at least should have tried to serve the food hot..the steak, therefore, turned hard to cut. I was even more disappointed with their service as i had booked the seat 1 week ago. I asked the window side seats. ...;30;
Their AC is old, second hand, dont work properly and last day water was coming from the AC..i have changed my seat several times due to the hot temp...their service aint that bad but they should take care their customer’s comfort. Their Sea food Soup is very good. I would love to visit again if they fix their AC asap....;20;
The rice they served was cool. Taste very bad price too high compared to quantity they serve;10;
very tasty food...!! no dough abt it;;VERDADEIRO
I like their food. No matter what they never dissapointed me with their food.;40;
Food was just 'OK'.Service was awful.;;FALSO
Firstly their ac didn't work just useless and secondly the behavior of their waiter is very disappointing with little kids they Scrolled my daughter several she was just playing in the restaurant and only our table was full and no other customer was there in that time they can't handle a little kid it's so disappointing and good quality was so so I will not complain abt the food Cz it can be improve but their attitude and behavior will never improve so I will think twice to visit there aging;10;
good food with good environment;;VERDADEIRO
Best Thai soup of the town;50;
really nice place with so many good ppls.;;VERDADEIRO
I liked the place.the food was good and so the environment.U should try at once if u r a food lover.U can try the chicken pop,it's very good.and I think the food price is comfortable.... I just love it....;40;
