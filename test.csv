Nice restaurant... Amazing pizza! One of the best I have tasted... Loved your service...,5.0,
Went there to avail an pasta offer! Found that the offer was totally wastage of tym n money .They r offering one small pasta free with large one.But the quantity is very poor.It seems lyk they just divided one pasta into two bowl.Cheese and meats were very little in amount and the so called large pasta is very expensive and small in quantity. Service is really poor.,1.0,

"It takes not more than 10 mins to serve food. Food is fresh and tasty.! Once u start to have the food, unless u take a sip of coke u won't gonna stop.! A place with beautiful lights and photographs. This is the place for everyone; it's a friendly place, a family time spending place, a romantic place, a meeting place, a warm place to have food.!",5.0,
"I tasted very poor quality food served by them yesterday. The food was so salty that I had to push them to change it. Though they changed it on my request but it was salty on 2nd attempt as well. Every time, they took 25-30 minutes to serve food. However, I had wonderful food experience at star lounge before but I don't think I am going there again. They have changed their chef which they admired on my query. Upon my complaints, the manager even didn't bother to apologise, rather she was irritated. Waste of money now a days!",1.0,
whats a food? Its more then my expectation. I loved and enjoyed it. The food was very testy and Yeamme. Obesly i will come agen.,5.0,
"The horriblest pizza I have ever tasted! the service was shockingly bad!! Looks can deceive!! the environment looked good, but food was bad,hospitality was worst! Had to call 3 times for order,they were too busy.....the pizza was ""chicken lounge pizza""! Crust was too thin, sooo hard couldn't chew,no scent or sign of chicken....they didn't serve any sauce,tissue,napkins,though asked 3/4 times....their price is overrated, proportion is insufficient.... asked for the bill 4 times,lastly had to go to cashier to pay...didn't even give receipt...after hearing our complain the manager didn't even apologise!!! just utterly shocked!!",1.0,
|Few days before Eid-ulFitr we had ifteri at your place but number of items served against the price 500 Tk per person was not impressive. The rice was not properly cooked and almost the whole dish was served cold. Since it is a renowned restaurant in the town should pay more attention for improvement about food and hospitality to retain customers.,3.0,
"I went there with my family & found that most of the cheap foods are not available. only the can offer the expensive ones. food taste was also horrible. behind, just 1 glass of cold drink, they charge 80 taka. isn't it too much. I mean adding 20 taka u can get 2ltr. where they are giving us abt 120ml costing 80 tk...!!!! we took Peri Peri Chicken package. but didn't taste good at all. Last of all..... NOT RECOMMEND.",2.0,
The quantity of food is not enough proportionate to its price and the foods are too spicy; not easy to have.hospitality and environment are not bad !!,3.0,
Service was very slow as i checked in there on previous week for ifter. I'm not also happy with food quality as i found very light-wattery Halim with tow piece of bone!!! It really shocking. Tea wasn't also good. It was not creamy at all. Only environment was good there. Hope it'll improve..,1.0,
I hv tasted chicken satay & lemon ice tea.its delicious & environment is also cool but they r not well behaved. So keep eye on that note.,3.0,
They served the order after 45 minutes. When we asked they told chicken just arrived. Peri Peri chicken was half cooked. Very expensive. Service very poor.,2.0,

Had chicken pasta and cashew nut salad. Pasta was very bland. Not enough seasonings and lack of any kind of taste. Amount of meat or mushroom was tiny. White sauce they surved was weird and .

The Pasta - it seems to me that I had a bowl of water with some cheese.....disgusting. Chicken Fry (leg) overcooked. Very much dissapointed of overall experience as we went with Family. I guess weather they are going to close their business very soon or they have a bunch of BigHead (!) chef (?) with bad tamper. üò†",,False

First of all give up the habit of hawking people like Gulistan to your restaurant..Haven't seen this ever at any elite restaurant of this area.. . had pasta here which was 3/5.. it lacked chicken and cheese horribly..you can hardly find any of these in the middle and last parts..I should also personally say it lacked salt and spice(don't know about other people).. I think you guys need to stop the buy 1 get 1 shit and instead bring up your focus to the taste... for decoration I would rate 4/5.. it looks good overall thanks to the decorators.. Best of luck for future.. hope you guys can make quick improvement and cope up with the other famous restaurants in the food valley named Khilgaon  ,3.0,

"This is by far the best pizzas I've had here at BD. Made by a man full of passion and dedication, I'd rate this a 10/10. The presentation of the pizza is beautiful. Its very neat and pleasing to the eye. I personally had the BBQ chicken pizza and the shrimp pizza and it tastes amazing. The meat is well cooked and tender. The meat alone tastes outstanding. The texture of the pizza is wonderful. Though it is layered by the sauce and meat and the cheeses on top, it still holds everything in place. It doesnt get soggy or soft which is essential for a good pizza. And not to forget, every bite gives you a very satisfying cheese pull which is to die for üòç Overall, i would highly recommend.",,True

They've a good ambience I must say. The service was fast and quick. The waiters were good at there job. But I didn't like the taste of their pizza and if you're not good at what you're offering then service and ambience won't do any good. There were sufficient amount of cheese but which tasted super crapy and I find the amount of onions were much more than the actual topping. I ordered the Family Size Double Trouble and Buffalo Wings. The wings tasted decent enough. So If before you visit this place give it a thought coz there are far better options.

"A person who knows me can tell that I just live for good food and I love eating at different places where it is a 5 star or anything else. The Friday brunch of Four Points by Sheraton is awesome to treat yourself after a hectic week. It is a place which is very soothing and their staffs will make sure that you'll feel cozy there. I have been to Le M√©ridien, Westin and Raddison too but if you ask me which place serves you the best food then I'll say it is Four Points by Sherat...on. Now let's talk about the food, the best thing they will serve you is live juice station from the entire brunch session. The live kitchen has a variety of items to offer and to me the prawn tempura and the omelette with cheese were the best. They also serve you live pasta station. I had the best white sauce pasta with cheese, spices and chicken today. It was so yummy that I had the desire to start licking the plate. The main dishes were yummy too. The main thing is they will set a line of main dishes that you will want to eat like no dishes you'll not want to eat. I had a very good experience today there and I highly recommend this place.",5.0,

"Well we had 1 ifter and 2 sehri in Four points, it is one of the indication of their improved menu and services! As their tower section is the new addition in the Ramadan menu, I must said they are providing great foods. Ramadan teaches us not to waste, so i tried to eat as much as possible but not keep any weste foods in the plate! I like the most is they did not put tons of variety rather quality foods and all that you can eat. All the stuffs are very friendly, they keep asking the guests if they need anything more. They tried to provide the best possible service. Apart from that. The view from the 24th floor is awesome! The manager Mr. Tareq and assistant manager Mr. Shaifur Rahman provide quality service and they are always on the move, asking guests if they were happy or not! Overall, we are satisfied customers! :)",5.0,

The Sehri buffet spread were completely worth of the price for a SPG property. It was good in taste. Some items were just outstanding like The 'Paya'or ' or 'nehari' Salad and fruits bar was good and main dishes were mouthwatering. Second visit is awaiting sometime soon.,5.0,
"They are charging almost 4,000 (3,999) BDT for the buffet but do not bother to make arrangement to keep the food warm. Cold food ruined the taste of the items. My brother went there with his guest yesterday & became embarrassed of the food situation. if you don't want to keep your kebabs hot, then don't charge that much cz other buffets are charging less but giving better service than you.

"quantity was there .. but lacked quality somewhat. nothing spectacular or exceptional to make it a stand apart experience. it was nice of them to include the juice bar with the buffet & service was upto the mark too. quality of beef being served can be improved, i found it bit hard to chew. desserts section was unimaginative .. lots of different types of cupcakes .. again nothing exceptional was noted.. lacked chocolate based items or any mousse & yogurts were missing too. BIGGEST DRAWBACK WAS SERVICE STOPPING AT 3:30 pm. In context of Bangladesh, it should have been minimum 4:00 pm. & a closeby smoking section would be nice. having 2 change lifts to get to their rooftop smoking area wasn't fun.",3.0,

"Very nice family place with good ambiance. Good food and better service. Will come again surely. Beverages should be included with the buffet.

"Staff were really friendly, everything works, loved it",5.0,
"Most of the items were below average. Though there are many dishes, most of them don't deserve more than a bite. The advertisement is not all revealing, though it mentions Buy 1 Get 1 on Stan Chart Cards, there are particular specifications of the cards with offer, not all Standard Chartered Cards are liable to get the offer. And most importantly, though the advertisement mentions the Buffet price to be 3542 ( all inclusive), what has not been mentioned is that this excludes all beverages including water which will be charged at an exhorbitant rate plus 26.5% extra VAT and service charge on that. So those who are planning to go to the Street Food Festival, think twice.",2.0,
The food was horrible compared to la meridian while taking price in account. The restaurant eatery was small and had a handful to offer.

"Located at the heart of the modern part of Dhaka, just at Gulshan-2 circle. the 28-floored Doreen Tower has been modified as this hotel. Though some of its floors are being used as office spaces but completely isolated from the hotel.

Their restaurant and food menus I experienced found very selective and well cooked. Restaurant is in 24th floor with good view of outside.

"Expanding business from Gulshan and Banani to Dhanmondi was a bad move for Pizza Roma basically cause it meant their quality being degraded.

"There are some newspapers in our Bangladesh and their main job is create propaganda. Bangladesh Pratidin is one of them. Also as it's part of Bashundhara it's another objective is to protect its heinous deeds. They don't bother to apologize, always spread out false, defamatory news. Another disturbing fact is they have now news channel which is also propaganda house. Main objective here is to propagation of Bashundhara. A cheap editor runs the newspaper, we shouldn't expect any good from them.",1.0,

"Dear All, I‚Äôm writing this for warning about a person who is a terror, land mafia and hypocrite in Chakaria Upazella, Cox‚Äôs Bazer. His name is Jafor Alam Chairman ‚Äì chairman of Chakaria Upezala. I came to know that he is doing lobbing to be a MP Cox‚Äôs Bazer, also note that he is not much educated and his all surrounding people are not good enough. Besides he is doing Awamilig. As I respect this Politics Party due to Nation Father Banga Bandhu Sheck Mujebur Rahman, But Mr. JAf...or Alam is using name and fame of Bangladesh Awamilig which is very unfortunet for us and me. This will be very dangerous for all chakaria upezala residence because he will make more black money and make more terrorism and land mafia in chakaria. If Hines, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Mrs. Shak Hasina approve him to be a MP of Chakaria then it will be wrong decision. Please choose someone who is educated, good in politics, helpful for people and may do development work. Thanks Raj",4.0,

But we were 7/8 sitting in the table. when we asked for more glass they gave us dirty glasses and that also after waiting for 5 minutes.

"3 of us attended for lunch. The decor was minimalist but clean. The waiters were pleasant but need proper training. As this is a new cuisine for most of us, we had to ask for recommendations. This was not voluntarily offered. Even after we advised them of our lack of knowledge about Sri Lankan food. The waiter appeared to suggest the most expensive dishes as opposed dishes that we'd like considering we were describing what we were in the mood for. Ordering the food was a chal...lenge. We ordered a set menu they had available as this would provide the most selection. We also ordered parathas, egg hoppers and a beef curry. The waiters did not make suggestions that we'd need to order this additional food but it was essential for a full meal. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Once it did, I admit it was tasty but most of it was very spicy. We were not aware of this. We can handle spice but we still would've appreciated the waiters making us aware of it. The staff mentioned 3/4 of our way through the meal that we had two drinks which came with the set menu that we'd ordered. Whether this was done to make us order more drinks or whether the waiters forgot....both are unattractive. The set menu was priced in a manner I would say appropriate but the curry was overpriced. It cost just under 4000tk for 3 of us and in all consideration, this was a tad over what we would've felt was appropriate. I hope the suggestions are considered thoughtfully. I enjoyed the food so we shall be back, inshallah.",3.0,

"The food was okay... but the service was terrible... th waiter told us tht it's going to take 20 minutes, but they served th food after 50 minutes!!!! The funniest thing is that they served the starter (chicken wings) after They served the main course...      Another thing is that they must rethink bout the portion of the rice they serve for 2 ppl in th platter!!!",3.0,

Way too overpriced with a very typical food type. The portion size is ridiculous. With some other foods we took an egg hopper which costs 197+10% SC +15%VAT plus and its exactly ‡¶°‡¶ø‡¶Æ ‡¶ö‡¶ø‡¶§‡¶á which we can get at 15 taka. We had to made ourselves satisfies by dining in at Time out just near Taste of Lanka to satisfy our tummy. The owner claimed they have to import everything from Srilanka (why a guy need to have eggs and beef from Srilanka I did not get it though) which sounded like comedy of Russel Peter to me........and I literally laughed out.....,2.0,

I have been with BFC's food since 2004.for me BFC chicken is the best in the town.I have visited almost all the branches in Dhaka and know many outlet managers those who are working for the last 20 years.But it is really sad to say, BFC, Mirpur 10 branch has got some problems. I have been there several times since I have shifted my residence in Mirpur. The staffs are not well mannered. I have shared some of them, incident 1: one... day they have served me wrong drinks, when i objected the waiter said, it is not possible. incident 2: sometime a portion of the total area is blocked, i requested manager, he ignored. last incident: When a half of the sweet corn are eaten i have found some parts of a steel dish washing net inside, I complained they wanted to give another but i said no.The young outlet Manager was in front of me turned around even saying sorry.I was horrified about thinking their cleaning stuff.Hope authority will frequent visit their outlets and will check hygienic food ,cooking stuff and customers feedback's.DROPBOX is the better idea.and managers should be well trained., so that other staffs can perform better.",2.0,

Had a horrible experience. First of all they made us wait for 45mins for the food. The quantity of the food was less than we have expected. Then after paying the bill we received changes of 2 torn notes of 100 tk that were glued which we didn't notice at the first place.Thank you soo much for the horrible experience.

"My first review consisted of 5 stars but today, I am bound to revise my review & mark it with 1 star. I am incredibly annoyed with the quantity & the quality of the food items which they provided from their Dhanmondi branch. I ordered online through pathao food. I ordered their platter, R2, & it seemed to me that I paid 2500+ taka for a mere box of French fries!!! I had the same platter twice, before, but they have seemingly deteriorated the quality & lowered the quantity of ...their food items. Probably, they re-use the oil in which they fry their items. There was a distinct smell of used oil. The fish fingers were unbelievably thin & small. I just could see French fries throughout the box & the calamaries & shrimps were very few in numbers. In Ramadan too, I experienced the same thing. I had enough of Manhattan Fish Market. Never ever going back there or ordering food online from them. They literally have lost a regular customer.",1.0,
Fantastic. great service nice interior,,True
I m really feeling sad to say that me and my friend went ur Dhanmondi branch today ... We ordered the Fish and chips (the best deal in the town) menu.... But they gave small pieces of 2 fishs...

"Yesterday's azan was at 6.46 PM. The restaurant had served tang and iced tea beforehand. After the azan, everyone around us had food, except 3 tables. I figured they'd be 4/5 mins late. But nope, we waited there till 7.05 PM and got no food, while there was a table of around 15 people who'd received their second servings by that time. One time, a waiter came to our table with food, we got really excited because we'd been somewhat fasting for an extra 15 minutes, but then the ...waiter went back because that food wasn't for our table; such a tease, innit. At around 7 PM while everyone there was eating their fish and chips and we were sitting with our glass of iced tea, they brought us some really unappetizing, complementary soup. I lost it at that point and asked why they are seating people if they can't make enough food. To which they replied ""Amra chai na kono customer mon kharap koruk."" Bro you aren't serving people food for iftar, I think that's enough for me to ""mon kharap."" So then we left the place, as soon as we get on the lift they say ""Apnader food chole ashche."" As if I'm ever going back. We went to BFC and had super wholesome fried chicken. No ragrets, but f u, The Manhattan FISH MARKET Bangladesh. There was more weird shit before this, of course. I'd asked on Facebook whether or not the restaurant takes reservations, and they'd replied that they don't have any booking system in their outlets. They said that they serve people on a ""first come, first serve"" basis so it'd be best if we show up at least 45 minutes before iftar. I called the number given on your Facebook page and website again today at around 3 pm to check if you really don't take bookings. The cellphone was switched off. So we went to the Dhanmondi outlet at 5 PM today, and they told us they couldn't seat two people because all seats were booked. I told them that whoever manages their social media doesn't know that they take bookings, and if I show up at 5 at a virtually empty restaurant that serves iftar ""first come, first get,"" then I should get a table. Then they found us a table, lol. They took our order for an iftar platter at around 6 pm. After 15 minutes or so, they came to confirm it, and their receipt had the items ""garlic mussels, water"" whereas we'd ordered fish and chips and chicken tenders. We told them that they'd taken a completely wrong order for some reason. I mean, I'd understand if they'd thought we ordered grilled fish instead of fried, but mussels???? What??? But then we got no food at all because MUSSELS KHAIBI NA TOH MANHATTAN FISH MARKET AISOS KEN",1.0,
The best sea food seller and passionate to serve emotionally in the region. just fell in love with their great service.,,True
This was my first visit to MFM and my experience was awful. I ordered chicken mussels calamari and for drinks I ordered sunset by the bay and lemongrass cooler. The drinks were so disgusting that we both could not take the second sip of those. The drinks were smelling like cockroach and cough syrup and the chicken was smelly too. The spice in the mussels was not good at all. The only good thing was the fries. I would not recommend this place for anything. We ordered coleslaw which was not served and thank God for that. We had some issues with the bill as well. They should improve the sincerity to their customers.,1.0,

This place is one of the only two decent seafood restaurants in Dhaka. This one provides a greater value for money and heartier portions. Did you ask for a single saucer of dipping?

"For the first time, I have ordered two pizzas for home delivery. When they arrived, there was a terrible smell from the chicken one (Mexican Hot). Maybe it was their misplaced extra topping that made it worse as I ordered for extra cheese and not a buck-load of mushrooms. The beef one (Beef Bolognese) had no pepperoni on it. Moreover, the cheese they put felt dry & dusty and the dough felt real hard to swallow. Subpar ingredients, false advertisements ??........ maybe, maybe ... Lesson well learnt. Ramadan is definitely not an apt time to order comfort food. I consider myself simply, unlucky in this gamble.",2.0,
1st time visited the place.. was extremely hungry.. requested the serving boy to give us the best options as we are new here.. unfortunately he did not guide us properly.. plus they playing the music too loudly so he did not listen our drinks order properly.. when we asked to change the drink.. he was very rude.. already we requested them to low the sound.. overall a horrible experience,,False
"We ordered their bowl-less pasta which is quite hyped these days. We had to wait for over 30 mins and their waiters were acting like the last nabab of bengal and it was hard to get their attention but everything was compensated when the food arrived. The pasta was exquisite, well cooked pasta mixed with few pieces of chicken and sausage with a well balanced sauce and cheese, the crust was crunchy and went quite well with the cream, cheese and other bits as well. Overall the whole thing was a beautiful package of bursting tastes that will explode in your mouth. To me, the food of a restaurant has the highest priority that's why I had to give it 5 stars, if i take their service into consideration, I might have given them 0. Happy fooding all!",5.0,

"Last food experience was horrible! I was craving for chicken cashew nut salad & thus ordered this from them, along with a set menu via Hungrynaki. The cashew nut salad which they provide with their set menu is completely different from that of the individual dish. I haven't, in my whole, tasted such disgusting chicken cashew nut salad. It smells like beguni & pakora. They fry extemely thin & mini slices of chicken,(almost invisible), by covering them up with a huge amount of ...besan & flour which is responsible for this weird smell. There was abnormal thick coating in each of the chicken slices. The cashew nut salad which they provide with the set menu atleast contains capicum slices but the individual dish contains onions & cucumber only! Horrible...horrible experience. My craving was being killed by their food & I literally threw it away. They should & must stop cheating people by coating up their meat pieces with unnecessary amount of besan & flour to make them look bigger. I had the same experience with one of their beef items. The quality of their wrapped prawns has deteriorated too. There is too much of noodles & the prawns are incredibly thin & small. & the dish is too try but previously their wrapped prawns were juicy. I used to order from them a lot via Hungrynaki but the last time made me too disappointed with the quality of their dishes & have decided not to order from them anymore since you get only fried besan & flour.",1.0,

Nice place nice Environment.,,True
Hello ! Im from banasree and kind of a frequent customer of baba rafi branch . Last couple of times i had a common problem in this branch. They are not willing to take order as per my choice from the given menu but i had to take the foods what they want due to their manpower or some other reason. Today also the same thing happened . There is a new menu launched Chicken quesadilla and i wanted to order but they are not taking this order as it will take time and i agreed to wait but still they wont coz its not easy for them to make ! My question is why you keep such item on menu when you are not taking the order and have to order as u want when u have a menu?? This is not common for other branch of baba rafi . I want management to look into this and take needed action on this .thanks .,2.0,
I did order from pathao. And The food was totally cold. It was beef fried chicken. It is the second time and last time.,,False
"It's good actually. The only problem i had was from a new item that i had yesterday. It was Tandoori Burger. It was too hot and spicy but was not mentioned in the description. It tasted really good, but a bit of heads up in the description would have been much better.",4.0,
Burger patty is very disappointingly tasteless and too much mayo that also didn't taste good. Incomplete menu,,False
"What‚Äôs up with your cost saving techniques? Ac out fans running, one man doing cash, preparation and serving. If you claim to be an international chain but serve like a local street shop. Literally, one guy taking 5 customers orders and the place is just crazy hot without AC. Terrible. Banasree Outlet.",1.0,
"They have the worst food possible. the chicken fry was all raw from inside. It had clotted blood and reddish pink flesh. When asked about this to the waiters, they said it was calcium coming out of bones, not clotted blood. i request everyone not to eat at baba rafi for ur own sake. u may end up with some bad disease for consuming these awful food.",,False
Ordered the kebab and was really surprised by the quantity of beef and other ingredients. i had to eat half the oily bread and then got the taste of the kebab. This is unacceptable from a food chain of this calibre. Serve your food the way it shows on the menu and dont deceive your customers.,2.0,
i tasted the chicken kebab and was really great!,,True

"We had the following (opposite NSU main gate 1 & 2): 1 Beef Burger = 99 Taka. Was pretty good. Loved the buns they use. The patty was good for the price range, despite being doused with a lot of sauce. Also, it is a very messy burger so make sure you get tissues. 2 Chicken Burgers = 198 Taka. The chicken burger is definitely the best item on the menu. Delicious patty which complements the soft sesame buns. They use the same sauces for both the beef and chicken burgers. Howeve...r, the sauce combo tastes much better with the chicken patty. 1 Beef Kebab = 99 Taka. The packaging is nice, the kabab wrap is decent. It is definitely not worth getting this for 99 taka. Also, the beef kebab has star anise in it, so if you don't like the smell of star anise, stay away from it! 1 Chicken Kebab = 99 Taka. Again, the chicken version is much better than the beef version. Still not worth 99 taka IMO. The meat to veggie ratio is waaaay off. They need to put more meat in this to be worth 99 taka. Tastes pretty good though. 1 Mountain Dew = 60 Taka. Regular fountain drink glass (not the tiny ones they give you at KFC or other places). Expensive yes, however it was pretty refreshing. Tasted like proper mountain dew (not some watered down version of it). Recommendations = stick to the chicken burgers. Definitely worth it!",4.0,
"went to Baba rafi 300 feet Bashundhara r/a they only serve 100 and 160 tk combo burger deal! One of the best burger in that price,, but i have to give points to fries,,its similar to Mcdonalds fries and Hungry Jacks i had in Australia. Beef Burger was juicy and the sauce they used was really nice with a hint of Garlic Im gonna be honest, i had most amount of burgers around dhaka from banani, malibag and mirpur, dhanmondi and 300 feet... Baba rafi beats all in price and taste and with excellent cooked fries! Top quality. Thats why i had two burgers!! N.B- every place we been to, customer service is never satisfactory, but this girl in baba rafi,,,she was kind, explainable and also served with smile where she was wearing hijab and with decency,,,5star for because she did that.

I ordered food using Pathao app. The restaurant calls me and say that price have changed and I have to pay about 250 taka more per items that I ordered. According to them the price did not get updated even though had changed the menu price. I agreed since didn't have much time to order again. Now the rib eye steaks that I ordered cost me 850 each. I received the items on time. The meat was not at all juicy and was so hard that I started to feel fatigue and pain i n my hand to cut. I couldn't finish it neither could my father. The price is excessively high and then you get something like this. I would have walked out if I was served it in the restaurant. The only thing that was good was the mashed potato tasted good.,1.0,

The Jazz Lovers platter definitely found a place in our favourite platter lists. The sauce on the steak was the cherry on the top and the whole combination definitely deserves a star.

Most likely among the best all rounder restaurent in the Khilgaon food street. However, I have bad experience in restaurants where they were good, and became lathergik later.

I didn't like their sea food assorted something, that dish had small crabs mostly which was not at all tasty. Price was 870/- including the VAT, but the amount was so less.",4.0,

If not for anything else I had to come to the page and write a review for the lamb itself..!! I usually never ever try lamb in restaurants but man did this blow me away  U MUST TRY THE LAMB  Overall I liked all the foods and we literally tried everything on the menu  The servers are also very polite and well-mannered.. All in all-the place maybe named 'Little Korea' but it has some big bold bang flavours waiting for u.. Will definitely come again ,5.0,
"Guys I'm sorry but your food tastes like Poorly cooked Indian food, might consider renaming the place to ""Little India"". I threw up after eating at Little Korea last week and I would not recommend anyone to come 5Kms within the place until you get chefs that can make decent food.",,False
"The food is good, service excellent. Salads and starters are tasty. Lambs are juicy but the sea food platter is insufficient. Kimchi was absent, chopsticks and crockeries are poor. Interior has to be improved a lot. The entry steps are risky, please try to reconstruct it properly.",3.0,

"1. Awful service. No one greeted or showed us where to sit. One of the waiters failed to fetch us a bottle of water. 2. The food is at best mediocre for the price. They are charging premium price. The service and the quality of the food should really be up to the mark. I'd be happy to change this review if they manage to improve. When you say ""from the founders of Tokyo Express"", it really is hard to cut them some slack.",1.0,
