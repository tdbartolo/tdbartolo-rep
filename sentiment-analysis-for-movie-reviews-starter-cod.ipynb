Videos from past offer from this course can be found [here](http://www.coc.ufrj.br/pt/sistema-online2/598-cursos-online/9417-cursos-online-disciplina-coc891-deep-learning)\n\nThe activity consists of a [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pec-dl-202101) between students to create deep learning models to predict sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. \n\nThis Starter Code presentes the data and two baseline models for students get started with the problem. At the end, a submission file is created and can be send directly to competition grader.
