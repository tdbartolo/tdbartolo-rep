(Their behavior & service both was horrible ..They served pasta with out spoon.. They forgot to give sauce & mayonnaise... we asked..After 15 minutes they gave sauce & mayonnaise..Drinks was very little amount though price was 25 tk..pizza was like a normal bread with cheese..didn't find any chicken pieces).

I took BBQ meal, chicken was good but rice quantity was so less. Need to improve,1.0,;
We went for the buy one get one offer!! They said- the offer is only for large bowl when we asked for regular bowl.(the offer was for regular bowl too..they tricked us).this is how you run your business??!!! Really disappointing!!

"I odered ur ""pizza barsa"" today. It was home - delivery nd buy 1 get one offer. I'm sorry to say but im much disappointed. Cheese nd toppings were really poor.

Me and my friend ordered Chicken cheese blast burger..according to name there wasnâ€™t enough cheese..there were green spots in both of the bun..oil was coming out from the burger in every bite..according to price it wasnâ€™t fair at all..,1.0,;
Ordered special mixed chowmein 1:2, 2 choco cold coffee, 2 pcs fried chicken, chowmein was just average given to the price it could have been a little crunchy, coffee was good, but the chicken was terrible as I couldnt find a single piece of chicken flesh in it, taste was awful later I complained and they replaced it with a better version of it. I will have their pizzas next I visit no more above mentioned,3.0,;
First time I was gone there. Place is soooo narrow & table is looks weird in this Restrurent. Service wasn't good enough. There was only 1 person who was on duty to take orders. About the food - chicken fry was good enough but pasta Basta was too much sweet in taste. That's why can't rate high. But painting was really amazing.,3.0,;

Good food, price ok but management toooooo bad. Because their is one person who taking all the orders and surveying the food. It's obvious that he can't managed all the things alone. It's 3rd time in @[1798844937050755:Cloud Flame] but last 2 time I got too much disturb. About last night, that was worse!!! I like the food but I maybe can't convince myself to go their for the 4th time.....,3.0,;

the ramadan special platters are worth every penny..i wish the place was a little bigger and less noisy..give it a try..you wont regret. :),4.0,;
They still didn't manage sufficient electricity supply when there is power failure. Tried the set A, they couldn't even serve sub and chicken fry. Had to wait till the power came. The pizza was average and so was the pasta. Chicken fry and sub was quite good though. It's been around 4 months since they opened it and they still didn't fix the electricity issue, and still didn't start accepting card payment. About the AC, they don't turn on all the ACs all the time, so you may... sweat at times. Should work on these things, to satisfy the customers. Price is reasonable according to the FOOD QUALITY. Hope for the best.,2.0,;

I tasted very poor quality food served by them yesterday. The food was so salty that I had to push them to change it. Though they changed it on my request but it was salty on 2nd attempt as well. Every time, they took 25-30 minutes to serve food. However, I had wonderful food experience at star lounge before but I don't think I am going there again. They have changed their chef which they admired on my query. Upon my complaints, the manager even didn't bother to apologise, rather she was irritated. Waste of money now a days!,1.0,;

"The horriblest pizza I have ever tasted! the service was shockingly bad!! Looks can deceive!! the environment looked good, but food was bad,hospitality was worst!

|Few days before Eid-ulFitr we had ifteri at your place but number of items served against the price 500 Tk per person was not impressive. The rice was not properly cooked and almost the whole dish was served cold. Since it is a renowned restaurant in the town should pay more attention for improvement about food and hospitality to retain customers.,3.0,;
I went there with my family & found that most of the cheap foods are not available. only the can offer the expensive ones. food taste was also horrible. behind, just 1 glass of cold drink, they charge 80 taka. isn't it too much. I mean adding 20 taka u can get 2ltr. where they are giving us abt 120ml costing 80 tk...!!!! we took Peri Peri Chicken package. but didn't taste good at all. Last of all..... NOT RECOMMEND.,2.0,;
The quantity of food is not enough proportionate to its price and the foods are too spicy; not easy to have.hospitality and environment are not bad !!,3.0,
Service was very slow as i checked in there on previous week for ifter. I'm not also happy with food quality as i found very light-wattery Halim with tow piece of bone!!! It really shocking. Tea wasn't also good. It was not creamy at all. Only environment was good there. Hope it'll improve..,1.0,;

I have bought 14inches pizza with 2 free large pasta offer for 850tk and additional 15%vat. The quality of pizza is simply disaster. Crust was burnt, only few pieces of chicken found here & there and cheese quantity was also not sufficient at all. So called 2 large pasta were another nightmare. You can imagine the taste from the pictures above. Tastes raw. Not recommended for anyone.,,False;

Had chicken pasta and cashew nut salad. Pasta was very bland. Not enough seasonings and lack of any kind of taste. Amount of meat or mushroom was tiny. White sauce they surved was weird and . Couldn't eat half of the pasta. Cashew nut salad was below average. Chicken in the salad was probably a few days old.,1.0,;
We visited the places at evening and it completely empty. We stayed there around 1 hour, not a single person came. ....Now I understand I should have a look the reviews before go. it's not about the environment or people over there, but the Food. I don't want to say it Worse or Spoil food, but the Food has no taste at all. The Burger ðŸ” taste like Bread and Chicken without salt. The Pasta - it seems to me that I had a bowl of water with some cheese.....disgusting. Chicken Fry (leg) overcooked. Very much dissapointed of overall experience as we went with Family. I guess weather they are going to close their business very soon or they have a bunch of BigHead (!) chef (?) with bad tamper. ðŸ˜ ,,False;

First of all give up the habit of hawking people like Gulistan to your restaurant..Haven't seen this ever at any elite restaurant of this area.. . had pasta here which was 3/5.. it lacked chicken and cheese horribly..you can hardly find any of these in the middle and last parts..I should also personally say it lacked salt and spice(don't know about other people).. I think you guys need to stop the buy 1 get 1 shit and instead bring up your focus to the taste... for decoration I would rate 4/5.. it looks good overall thanks to the decorators.. Best of luck for future.. hope you guys can make quick improvement and cope up with the other famous restaurants in the food valley named Khilgaon ï¿½,3.0,;

I heard about this place from one of my frnd and went there with my brother.Two times we have been there.the first time we went , wasn't very sure about the taste of authentic pizza taste of there but when we ordered and ate the chicken pizza it was quite good. the other day we ordered a lot ,though peri peri chicken platter was too spicy to eat..yet they tried to manage upto it. overall a nice place to have good food and hang over,,True;
Excellent food, nice space...,,True;
We had to wait more than one hour for food .. and later we asked for additional salad and they failed to serve that on time . ( Our food was finished by the time they served it) . About the food : ordered hariali kabab with garlic nan. Kabab was good but couldn't find any difference between garlic nan and regular one .,2.0,;
It was over early period when we visited this place.Really nice and budget friendly place for pizza lovers.,,True;
The taste of the pizza was very bad. Although they say the cheese will be more in chicken Supreme pizza, There was no cheese in pizza. Very dirty places.,1.0,;
Given the price it was hard to believe they were able to pull it off....kudos to you guys. Good for a date . Good for a casual hangout or a meet up. Best not to bring family here though as the customer base for this shop is mostly teenagers or people like me with a shallow pocket.,5.0,;
1. The crust was really thin, almost like a Ruti. 2. Amount of cheese was not bad. 3. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant, there was hardly any chicken even masroom in the chicken supreme pizza. You can also count the olives. 4. The overall taste was good but for 279tk, considering the toppings, it was overpriced. The making of pizza in an oven in front of you is the main attention. You can give it a try but not really a place to go back just to have the pizza. Definitely overhyped and overrated. Best of luck.,2.0,;
Well the crust was really thin, almost felt Like a Nun Ruti. Amount of cheese was okay. Among the toppings, tomatoes and onions were abundant in the beef pizza. Portion of beef is again okay though there was hardly any chicken in the chicken pizza. You can also count the olives. The overall taste was good for 200tk. But considering the toppings, 200 tk is not cheap rather an okay price tag. They only have 8 inch pizzas. For a guy like me, I could easily eat Two and go for ...,3.0,;
Well as i was born and bought up in this area I had basically tried all kinds of food around this place...so not gonna lie....

"Their behaviour was bad, i repeat their ""BEHAVIOUR"" was ""BAD"". We wanted some change as we gave all of our ""khuchra"" tk at the time of order. But they didn't even have the courtesy to say politely that they didn't have any change, it was like we were beggars asking them for money. We ordered both chicken and beef, the amount of chicken was really poor, it was really a fancy cheese version of typical local pizza. So don't get confused by the price.,1.0,";

But I didn't see anyone there to take the empty plates. They did took the plates but after people left from the table. Its just lack of training.i worked and study in hotel management abord and I run many places abord so I have bit idea in hospitality sector so I hope the management will see my review and they will fix those small issue.

Last night I along with my 03 colleagues went there for buffet dinner. The items like beef or mutton curry were not up to the mark, meat lovers like us may be disappointed. 02 items of soup, fried chicken and noodles were good. Surprisingly, we found no item of prawn. We felt salads and dessert items poor and limited. I found small hair in different dishes which disturbed me a lot but I did not say anything as my mates could lose their appetite. Ambience and behaviour were good. Overall response is that Tk 800++ price for that standard buffet dinner is quite much and they must improve to ensure hygiene.,2.0,;

Great food!!! Delicious, fresh and mouth watering! LOVED IT!! And very impressed with the service!,,True;
Great food at reasonable price. The portions are large and adequate amount of toppings!,,True;
I would surely recommend Slice O' for the taste and ample amount of meat, and considering their price, it's definitely value for money. Oh and from my experience, they are quite customer friendly!,,True;
This is by far the best pizzas I've had here at BD. Made by a man full of passion and dedication, I'd rate this a 10/10. The presentation of the pizza is beautiful. Its very neat and pleasing to the eye. I personally had the BBQ chicken pizza and the shrimp pizza and it tastes amazing. The meat is well cooked and tender. The meat alone tastes outstanding. The texture of the pizza is wonderful. Though it is layered by the sauce and meat and the cheeses on top, it still holds everything in place. It doesnt get soggy or soft which is essential for a good pizza. And not to forget, every bite gives you a very satisfying cheese pull which is to die for ðŸ˜ Overall, i would highly recommend.,,True;
Great pizza, delicious cheese overload. Must try bbq chicken and tonduri chicken pizza. If you want different taste , try their tuna pizza. I love it,,True;
Best ðŸ•Pizzas!! Highly recommending!,,True;
definitely the place you can rely om when you have cravings for pizza!!!!!!!,,True;
The best homemade pizza in town now,,True;

"thursday i visited khilgaon branch with my friends for iftar. With a great expectation we ordered two SET FOR 2 items, but after seeing the platter we were at a loss that ; as the platter including that pizza and pasta was totally a joke!!!!!!!!!!!! at first pizza was 6 inches , and we cant choose any flavor, secondly we were not allowed to choose pasta too. and lastly when we started eating the pasta was nothing but only boiled pasta with no flavor at all. And all this cos... a total horrible experience and we never expected that. At least you should had maintained your pizza and pasta quality. A totally overpriced platter. i am a regular customer of alfresco dhanmondi branch , but i must say khilgaon branch must be the worst.,1.0,";

Interior was good but it was full of mosquitoes.It's better to chew peanuts in zoo than having pizza here.The softdrinks they served was pale,may be water was mixed with it.And last but not the least rather most important thing that this place introduced us with a whole new definition of chocolate lava cake! they served doraemon cake (which anyone can find in any grocery shop,10/- each) with chocolate syrup on it & named it chocolate lava cake....ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½,1.0,;

They've a good ambience I must say. The service was fast and quick. The waiters were good at there job. But I didn't like the taste of their pizza and if you're not good at what you're offering then service and ambience won't do any good. There were sufficient amount of cheese but which tasted super crapy and I find the amount of onions were much more than the actual topping. I ordered the Family Size Double Trouble and Buffalo Wings. The wings tasted decent enough. So If before you visit this place give it a thought coz there are far better options. And Yeah The Pricing was okay for me not expensive at all and obviously affordable. Thanks,2.0,;

I was in a mood for pizza today and wanted to try something new. After having received the ad cut menu on my door a month ago,B.B.Q Al Pollo pizza was on my mind. So decided to try it out today. Tried out the cheesy pepperoni pizza along with chicken wings. The wings were delicious, sweet and mildly spiced. The pizza was very tasty, had a lot of Parmesan, cheddar and mozzarella cheese flavour accompanied by pepperoni. This was fully satisfactory meal. Wouldn't hesitate to come back again.,5.0,;

"Got 2 pizzas an hour back through foodpanda. I must say I'm very disappointed with the amount of toppings you guys have given.

I wish I could have shared some pictures of food here ... food , ambience, service and their marketing strategy is really smart ! I have tried their blue brunch offer ... after having delicious heavy breakfast we used their swimming pool for an hour , relaxed for few minutes ... then we had our lunch ... every items were perfectly cooked .. staffs were taking care of the food section every time .. that gives a good impression of a classy restaurant .. and the desserts are re...ally good ... I highly recommend to have their sushi , fish and beef steak ... I am going to try their new offers soon .. can't wait to share the wonderful eating experience with family and friends .. P.s. Plz try not to waste food ... take small portion . They offer a lot and refill food time to time . I personally feel so bad when good food in fact any kind of foods are being wasted !,5.0,;

We were 6 people went to Four points to have brunch yesterday. It was a good experience specially with the 1 hour complementary access to the pool. We had lots of fun there. The view was amazing. Ambience was good and most foods were tasty except the Hilsha fish. Staffs were good and overall experience was good.

The Eatery has one of the best buffet dinners in Dhaka. Small but decorated and with a great view from the 24th floor. The grilled river prawns, beef fillet mignion, penne arabiata, teriyaki beef, prawn dopiaza, in house ice cream, chocolate mousse are a must try.,5.0,;
Loved the food and service! Had the weekend brunch offer this Friday and it was absolutely scrumptious!,5.0,;
their brunch buffet is the best buffet in town without anydoubt..and their service is outstanding ..behaviour with customers is extremely good...the food items are heaven ...extremely tasty,5.0,;
A person who knows me can tell that I just live for good food and I love eating at different places where it is a 5 star or anything else. The Friday brunch of Four Points by Sheraton is awesome to treat yourself after a hectic week. It is a place which is very soothing and their staffs will make sure that you'll feel cozy there. I have been to Le MÃ©ridien, Westin and Raddison too but if you ask me which place serves you the best food then I'll say it is Four Points by Sherat...on. Now let's talk about the food, the best thing they will serve you is live juice station from the entire brunch session. The live kitchen has a variety of items to offer and to me the prawn tempura and the omelette with cheese were the best. They also serve you live pasta station. I had the best white sauce pasta with cheese, spices and chicken today. It was so yummy that I had the desire to start licking the plate. The main dishes were yummy too. The main thing is they will set a line of main dishes that you will want to eat like no dishes you'll not want to eat. I had a very good experience today there and I highly recommend this place.,5.0,;
Their complimentary beverages services need to be improved.,3.0,;

Just 2 problems , in my opinion: ** Coffee = Needs to be NOT THIS MUCH LIQUIDY , NO MATTER WHAT THE BLEND IS. ** Price and proportion = especially coffee proportion... could be the opposite of the conventional. Lower the price and Higher the quantity and quality the better . Otherwise , the staff people , the ambiance all of it is Amazing .... !!! ... Thank you .,4.0,;

My first interaction with four points was in the month of Ramadan during one of the Sehri. Since I was there with my friends, therefore I decided that I must get my family someday over here.

The place was really nice...the quality of the served dishes were also up to the mark.definitely will visit again.,5.0,;
Well we had 1 ifter and 2 sehri in Four points, it is one of the indication of their improved menu and services! As their tower section is the new addition in the Ramadan menu, I must said they are providing great foods. Ramadan teaches us not to waste, so i tried to eat as much as possible but not keep any weste foods in the plate! I like the most is they did not put tons of variety rather quality foods and all that you can eat. All the stuffs are very friendly, they keep asking the guests if they need anything more. They tried to provide the best possible service. Apart from that. The view from the 24th floor is awesome! The manager Mr. Tareq and assistant manager Mr. Shaifur Rahman provide quality service and they are always on the move, asking guests if they were happy or not! Overall, we are satisfied customers! :),5.0,;
Nice hospitality. Go ahead . Wish all the best all member and Mar.,5.0,;
The Sehri buffet spread were completely worth of the price for a SPG property. It was good in taste. Some items were just outstanding like The 'Paya'or ' or 'nehari' Salad and fruits bar was good and main dishes were mouthwatering. Second visit is awaiting sometime soon.,5.0,;
They are charging almost 4,000 (3,999) BDT for the buffet but do not bother to make arrangement to keep the food warm. Cold food ruined the taste of the items. My brother went there with his guest yesterday & became embarrassed of the food situation. if you don't want to keep your kebabs hot, then don't charge that much cz other buffets are charging less but giving better service than you. Pissed Off,2.0,;
I like the service and the making selection of food. I was quite please overall and looking to go back again.,5.0,;
Good menu but mediocre taste. Nothing exciting to the palate. The fruit table was good as was the nehari. Other items were ... Just there.,2.0,;

It was awesome. I wanna go their again. wish all the best,3.0,;
Clearly a waste of time and money . The dishes were way below average . Nothing resembled the advertisement. Pure Deshi cuisine plus a few salads and desserts is not worth 2200 taka. Last but not least , the restroom was dirty and stall was too small for a hotel. ... Pizza Hut has a bigger washroom than yours . Definitely not coming back here anymore . Shall never recommend anyone to come here either .,1.0,;
Its a beautiful restaurant good food and good view,3.0,;
quantity was there .. but lacked quality somewhat. nothing spectacular or exceptional to make it a stand apart experience. it was nice of them to include the juice bar with the buffet & service was upto the mark too. quality of beef being served can be improved, i found it bit hard to chew. desserts section was unimaginative .. lots of different types of cupcakes .. again nothing exceptional was noted.. lacked chocolate based items or any mousse & yogurts were missing too. BIGGEST DRAWBACK WAS SERVICE STOPPING AT 3:30 pm. In context of Bangladesh, it should have been minimum 4:00 pm. & a closeby smoking section would be nice. having 2 change lifts to get to their rooftop smoking area wasn't fun.,3.0,;
Tried buffet , average , a bit frustrating as majority items are not tasty. Good part availability of juices in buffet . Our expectation is higher , hope to see you like that , Good Luck:),3.0,;
This was worse experience of being there at eatery restaurant. In the street food market fest there were no Chinese dim sum station. There was sushi but very limited. Bottom line is they show something and in reality they serve something else. This is one way of cheating people. Food quality is very low.,1.0,;
foods were fantastic and MS. Cecilia Gomes (asst. manager-sales) was so cordial and showed us venue, room and swimming pool. It was a great time in Four Points by Sheraton Dhaka. I'll definitely come with my family as well as love to recommend my friends, family and colleagues to enjoy excellent service of this hotel.,5.0,;

Review#1 Great new food joint in Dhaka City. Refreshing and mouthwatering. My new favorite place for buffet. Review#2 Simply Great. the best sea food place in town.,5.0,;
Very nice family place with good ambiance. Good food and better service. Will come again surely. Beverages should be included with the buffet. When you've advertised that the price mentioned is of all inclusive, then charging of VAT & others shouldn't be in place.... That doesn't bring good news to YOU. Anyway, overall I liked it and visit again to see new developments. Cheers!,5.0,;
Staff were really friendly, everything works, loved it,5.0,;
Most of the items were below average. Though there are many dishes, most of them don't deserve more than a bite. The advertisement is not all revealing, though it mentions Buy 1 Get 1 on Stan Chart Cards, there are particular specifications of the cards with offer, not all Standard Chartered Cards are liable to get the offer. And most importantly, though the advertisement mentions the Buffet price to be 3542 ( all inclusive), what has not been mentioned is that this excludes all beverages including water which will be charged at an exhorbitant rate plus 26.5% extra VAT and service charge on that. So those who are planning to go to the Street Food Festival, think twice.,2.0,;
The food was horrible compared to la meridian while taking price in account. The restaurant eatery was small and had a handful to offer. I called them up to enquire about the maki rolls before going and found premade small rolls that was tasteless and looked cheep. Their continental side had few things to offer aswell. All in all dnt waste your money and time.,1.0,;

the one star is for the ambience and the lamb chops in the buffet. all the other items were pretty bad and they sucked. really SUCKED!

Will I be back? Probably - if someone treats me...,3.0,;
Located at the heart of the modern part of Dhaka, just at Gulshan-2 circle. the 28-floored Doreen Tower has been modified as this hotel. Though some of its floors are being used as office spaces but completely isolated from the hotel. They have started new, some of their staffs I met have been recruited from other hotels like Westine, Amari etc. and they know well how provide service to customers. Their restaurant and food menus I experienced found very selective and well cooked. Restaurant is in 24th floor with good view of outside. Specially their restaurant lounge at 27th floor will give you a splendid beautiful overview of the city which must be liked by all to have some time there to drink, smoke or to dine with nearest ones, so don't miss it!,4.0,;

Pizza is my favorite food because it tastes and smells fabulous.i loved pizza roma â¤ðŸ‘Œ,,True;
I always like their pizza specially chili lime prawn and the pepperoni pizza. However was extremely disappointed with meatball spaghetti and the store donâ€™t serve any mineral water neither they provide any house water in Dhanmondi branch that is disappointing....,,True;
Expanding business from Gulshan and Banani to Dhanmondi was a bad move for Pizza Roma basically cause it meant their quality being degraded. A stale pizza diavola with a hard crust and chewy dough was delivered with no sauces or chili flakes, especially when extra sauces was an added request. More than annoying, bad pizzas are just disappointing specifically considering Pizza Roma is the pizzeria we've all come to love.,1.0,;
"the worst Pizza I ever ate :( we order the meatball pizza 12"" there is total 17balls in pizza (small size)which was fully testless.poor amount of cheese.the pizza was properly not sizzling with salt.the test was like as, ""a pizza which is made with brinjal or Eggplants fully dull in test....!!!"",,False";

There are some newspapers in our Bangladesh and their main job is create propaganda. Bangladesh Pratidin is one of them. Also as it's part of Bashundhara it's another objective is to protect its heinous deeds. They don't bother to apologize, always spread out false, defamatory news. Another disturbing fact is they have now news channel which is also propaganda house. Main objective here is to propagation of Bashundhara. A cheap editor runs the newspaper, we shouldn't expect any good from them.,1.0,;

Dear All, Iâ€™m writing this for warning about a person who is a terror, land mafia and hypocrite in Chakaria Upazella, Coxâ€™s Bazer. His name is Jafor Alam Chairman â€“ chairman of Chakaria Upezala. I came to know that he is doing lobbing to be a MP Coxâ€™s Bazer, also note that he is not much educated and his all surrounding people are not good enough. Besides he is doing Awamilig. As I respect this Politics Party due to Nation Father Banga Bandhu Sheck Mujebur Rahman, But Mr. JAf...or Alam is using name and fame of Bangladesh Awamilig which is very unfortunet for us and me. This will be very dangerous for all chakaria upezala residence because he will make more black money and make more terrorism and land mafia in chakaria. If Hines, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Mrs. Shak Hasina approve him to be a MP of Chakaria then it will be wrong decision. Please choose someone who is educated, good in politics, helpful for people and may do development work. Thanks Raj,4.0,;

"The menu is tempting. Prices seems reasonable. Food quality? I doubt! Every dishes I ordered today, but the garlic naan, was way too salty. I guess it was quite flavourful but that salt just couldn't let me enjoy the food. Top of it when I complaint the issues by saying, ""your food was great but too much salty"", it seemed like it wasn't much of an issue for the staffs. They didn't even bother saying a sorry!,2.0,";
I dnt knw abt the quality of food. Waited a long time but no one served the menu until we asked for it. Then we started waiting again, bt no one bother to take order. Finally we got out of the restaurant & again no one bothered.,1.0,;

I went there in January and there were no coffee or juice. I was told that coffee will be available from February 2 or 4th as they need to fix their machine. Recently I went there on March 9th and found out that they need more time to fix their machine. So, I could not get anything other than coke or sprites. They have a limited menu and sadly not all the foods were available on that menu. Chicken a-la-kiev that I ordered was bland and raw smell was coming from the chicken.But their environment and service was quite good, I have to give them that.,2.0,;
Foods and environment just wow! But they need to appoint some professional waiters. I noticed that maximum waiters don't care about the gents customer when they get ladies customer. So, I think the restaurant authority should strongly handle that matter.,4.0,;

High price, low quality, very poor and lengthy service, you won't get drinks but your food will be finish as counter is different and most of the time there is nobody in the counter for taking order or even giving delivery. 3 times had to ask in 3 counter who will take order then someone came, they were watching that people are waiting to give order but nobody came by themselves. Same for delivery, said it will take 5 mins but even after 15 minutes no sign of food, then found food is at their counter and again nobody is there. Not recommended at all.,,False;

3 of us attended for lunch. The decor was minimalist but clean. The waiters were pleasant but need proper training. As this is a new cuisine for most of us, we had to ask for recommendations. This was not voluntarily offered. Even after we advised them of our lack of knowledge about Sri Lankan food. The waiter appeared to suggest the most expensive dishes as opposed dishes that we'd like considering we were describing what we were in the mood for. Ordering the food was a chal...lenge. We ordered a set menu they had available as this would provide the most selection. We also ordered parathas, egg hoppers and a beef curry. The waiters did not make suggestions that we'd need to order this additional food but it was essential for a full meal. It took over 20 minutes for the food to arrive. Once it did, I admit it was tasty but most of it was very spicy. We were not aware of this. We can handle spice but we still would've appreciated the waiters making us aware of it. The staff mentioned 3/4 of our way through the meal that we had two drinks which came with the set menu that we'd ordered. Whether this was done to make us order more drinks or whether the waiters forgot....both are unattractive. The set menu was priced in a manner I would say appropriate but the curry was overpriced. It cost just under 4000tk for 3 of us and in all consideration, this was a tad over what we would've felt was appropriate. I hope the suggestions are considered thoughtfully. I enjoyed the food so we shall be back, inshallah.,3.0,;
The food was fantastic ,too spicy,too yummy ï¿½ I'll visit you again ï¿½ï¿½,5.0,;
The food was okay... but the service was terrible... th waiter told us tht it's going to take 20 minutes, but they served th food after 50 minutes!!!! The funniest thing is that they served the starter (chicken wings) after They served the main course... ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Another thing is that they must rethink bout the portion of the rice they serve for 2 ppl in th platter!!!,3.0,;

The service was very good and the food was good too. The egg hopper, the egg rotti were just perfect along with deviled squids and the negombo beef curry. The pol sambol wasn't upto the mark though. They should add some more variety coz Sri Lanka offers a variety of dishes. Suggest to add Sri Lankan Tamil variety too especially the Jaffna style preparation which is more rich in flavor. Lovely staff and good ambience too,5.0,;

Way too overpriced with a very typical food type. The portion size is ridiculous. With some other foods we took an egg hopper which costs 197+10% SC +15%VAT plus and its exactly à¦¡à¦¿à¦® à¦šà¦¿à¦¤à¦‡ which we can get at 15 taka. We had to made ourselves satisfies by dining in at Time out just near Taste of Lanka to satisfy our tummy. The owner claimed they have to import everything from Srilanka (why a guy need to have eggs and beef from Srilanka I did not get it though) which sounded like comedy of Russel Peter to me........and I literally laughed out.....,2.0,;

I have been going to BFC since 2002/2003. I love their chicken & super cheese burger, my friends used to fear me coz I always wanted to go BFC..haha. but last few years I am not going regular only occasionally, maybe coz there test & quality is not as before but mostly there staff behaviour is really bad sometimes. worst one was recently at there Mohammadpur outlet, I have orderd 4 pic chicken & other things, they gave me 2 Thai & 2 leg. so I asked them can I have a breast pi...c & they just rudely replied that it's there company policy that in 4 pic chicken they will give 2 leg pic & I was just socked coz first he can give a breast by changing a Thai & secondly I have going to BFC since long & was regular at Uttara Jasimuddin branch for long time & never got that kind of behaviour & most of all never heard that policy & it's been almost 15/16 years I have been going there. I will still go there maybe less & maybe not at Mohammadpur but I will go coz I still love having those chicken & just wish they would keep there quality & look after there staff.,,True;

Caution: Experience sharing for better serving. I have been with BFC's food since 2004.for me BFC chicken is the best in the town.I have visited almost all the branches in Dhaka and know many outlet managers those who are working for the last 20 years.But it is really sad to say, BFC, Mirpur 10 branch has got some problems. I have been there several times since I have shifted my residence in Mirpur. The staffs are not well mannered. I have shared some of them, incident 1: one... day they have served me wrong drinks, when i objected the waiter said, it is not possible. incident 2: sometime a portion of the total area is blocked, i requested manager, he ignored. last incident: When a half of the sweet corn are eaten i have found some parts of a steel dish washing net inside, I complained they wanted to give another but i said no.The young outlet Manager was in front of me turned around even saying sorry.I was horrified about thinking their cleaning stuff.Hope authority will frequent visit their outlets and will check hygienic food ,cooking stuff and customers feedback's.DROPBOX is the better idea.and managers should be well trained., so that other staffs can perform better.,2.0,;

Most importantly their #meyo tasted weird as it had some kind of fish oil in it ...,2.0,;
food taste is too bad and price is high,,False;

Had a horrible experience. First of all they made us wait for 45mins for the food. The quantity of the food was less than we have expected.

My first review consisted of 5 stars but today, I am bound to revise my review & mark it with 1 star. I am incredibly annoyed with the quantity & the quality of the food items which they provided from their Dhanmondi branch. I ordered online through pathao food. I ordered their platter, R2, & it seemed to me that I paid 2500+ taka for a mere box of French fries!!! I had the same platter twice, before, but they have seemingly deteriorated the quality & lowered the quantity of ...their food items. Probably, they re-use the oil in which they fry their items. There was a distinct smell of used oil. The fish fingers were unbelievably thin & small. I just could see French fries throughout the box & the calamaries & shrimps were very few in numbers. In Ramadan too, I experienced the same thing. I had enough of Manhattan Fish Market. Never ever going back there or ordering food online from them. They literally have lost a regular customer.,1.0,;
Fantastic. great service nice interior,,True;
I m really feeling sad to say that me and my friend went ur Dhanmondi branch today ... We ordered the Fish and chips (the best deal in the town) menu.... But they gave small pieces of 2 fishs...

"Yesterday's azan was at 6.46 PM. The restaurant had served tang and iced tea beforehand. After the azan, everyone around us had food, except 3 tables. I figured they'd be 4/5 mins late. But nope, we waited there till 7.05 PM and got no food, while there was a table of around 15 people who'd received their second servings by that time. One time, a waiter came to our table with food, we got really excited because we'd been somewhat fasting for an extra 15 minutes, but then the ...waiter went back because that food wasn't for our table; such a tease, innit. At around 7 PM while everyone there was eating their fish and chips and we were sitting with our glass of iced tea, they brought us some really unappetizing, complementary soup. I lost it at that point and asked why they are seating people if they can't make enough food. To which they replied ""Amra chai na kono customer mon kharap koruk."" Bro you aren't serving people food for iftar, I think that's enough for me to ""mon kharap."" So then we left the place, as soon as we get on the lift they say ""Apnader food chole ashche."" As if I'm ever going back. We went to BFC and had super wholesome fried chicken. No ragrets, but f u, The Manhattan FISH MARKET Bangladesh. There was more weird shit before this, of course. I'd asked on Facebook whether or not the restaurant takes reservations, and they'd replied that they don't have any booking system in their outlets. They said that they serve people on a ""first come, first serve"" basis so it'd be best if we show up at least 45 minutes before iftar. I called the number given on your Facebook page and website again today at around 3 pm to check if you really don't take bookings. The cellphone was switched off. So we went to the Dhanmondi outlet at 5 PM today, and they told us they couldn't seat two people because all seats were booked. I told them that whoever manages their social media doesn't know that they take bookings, and if I show up at 5 at a virtually empty restaurant that serves iftar ""first come, first get,"" then I should get a table. Then they found us a table, lol. They took our order for an iftar platter at around 6 pm. After 15 minutes or so, they came to confirm it, and their receipt had the items ""garlic mussels, water"" whereas we'd ordered fish and chips and chicken tenders. We told them that they'd taken a completely wrong order for some reason. I mean, I'd understand if they'd thought we ordered grilled fish instead of fried, but mussels???? What??? But then we got no food at all because MUSSELS KHAIBI NA TOH MANHATTAN FISH MARKET AISOS KEN,1.0,";

This was my first visit to MFM and my experience was awful. I ordered chicken mussels calamari and for drinks I ordered sunset by the bay and lemongrass cooler. The drinks were so disgusting that we both could not take the second sip of those. The drinks were smelling like cockroach and cough syrup and the chicken was smelly too. The spice in the mussels was not good at all. The only good thing was the fries. I would not recommend this place for anything. We ordered coleslaw which was not served and thank God for that. We had some issues with the bill as well. They should improve the sincerity to their customers.,1.0,;

This place is one of the only two decent seafood restaurants in Dhaka. This one provides a greater value for money and heartier portions. Did you ask for a single saucer of dipping? They'll give you 5 different sauces and an assortment of condiments. Did you ask for the menu? They'll land a 500 page illustrated epic noble of fishes and crustaceans on your table.

I loved all of the food from Manhattan but its So disappointed! Extremely unprofessional! You guys should do a thorough background check before hiring druggheaded criminals as your employees! If people can't have their meals in peace outside, then why pay service charge? No waiter or manager of any company has the right to physically and mentally attack a customer like this! And please, fire all the employees who are even slightly associated with this. Its a request. I understand you guys have a global reputation, but its not more important than a person's life.,,True;

For the first time, I have ordered two pizzas for home delivery. When they arrived, there was a terrible smell from the chicken one (Mexican Hot). Maybe it was their misplaced extra topping that made it worse as I ordered for extra cheese and not a buck-load of mushrooms. The beef one (Beef Bolognese) had no pepperoni on it. Moreover, the cheese they put felt dry & dusty and the dough felt real hard to swallow. Subpar ingredients, false advertisements ??........ maybe, maybe ... Lesson well learnt. Ramadan is definitely not an apt time to order comfort food. I consider myself simply, unlucky in this gamble.,2.0,;
1st time visited the place.. was extremely hungry.. requested the serving boy to give us the best options as we are new here.. unfortunately he did not guide us properly.. plus they playing the music too loudly so he did not listen our drinks order properly.. when we asked to change the drink.. he was very rude.. already we requested them to low the sound.. overall a horrible experience,,False;
We ordered their bowl-less pasta which is quite hyped these days. We had to wait for over 30 mins and their waiters were acting like the last nabab of bengal and it was hard to get their attention but everything was compensated when the food arrived. The pasta was exquisite, well cooked pasta mixed with few pieces of chicken and sausage with a well balanced sauce and cheese, the crust was crunchy and went quite well with the cream, cheese and other bits as well. Overall the whole thing was a beautiful package of bursting tastes that will explode in your mouth. To me, the food of a restaurant has the highest priority that's why I had to give it 5 stars, if i take their service into consideration, I might have given them 0. Happy fooding all!,5.0,;
Today I ordered a pizza nd a burger from gamblers. The taste was horrible of the burger I think they just send me a piece of chicken, a bun nd some sauceðŸ˜’ Over all I hated it.. On the other hand the taste of pizza was good.. Atleast better than the burger ðŸ˜ª,,False;

Last food experience was horrible! I was craving for chicken cashew nut salad & thus ordered this from them, along with a set menu via Hungrynaki. The cashew nut salad which they provide with their set menu is completely different from that of the individual dish. I haven't, in my whole, tasted such disgusting chicken cashew nut salad. It smells like beguni & pakora. They fry extemely thin & mini slices of chicken,(almost invisible), by covering them up with a huge amount of ...besan & flour which is responsible for this weird smell. There was abnormal thick coating in each of the chicken slices. The cashew nut salad which they provide with the set menu atleast contains capicum slices but the individual dish contains onions & cucumber only! Horrible...horrible experience. My craving was being killed by their food & I literally threw it away. They should & must stop cheating people by coating up their meat pieces with unnecessary amount of besan & flour to make them look bigger. I had the same experience with one of their beef items. The quality of their wrapped prawns has deteriorated too. There is too much of noodles & the prawns are incredibly thin & small. & the dish is too try but previously their wrapped prawns were juicy. I used to order from them a lot via Hungrynaki but the last time made me too disappointed with the quality of their dishes & have decided not to order from them anymore since you get only fried besan & flour.,1.0,;

worst food...bad behaviour of the waiters...,,False;
Nice place nice Environment.,,True;
Hello ! Im from banasree and kind of a frequent customer of baba rafi branch . Last couple of times i had a common problem in this branch. They are not willing to take order as per my choice from the given menu but i had to take the foods what they want due to their manpower or some other reason. Today also the same thing happened . There is a new menu launched Chicken quesadilla and i wanted to order but they are not taking this order as it will take time and i agreed to wait but still they wont coz its not easy for them to make ! My question is why you keep such item on menu when you are not taking the order and have to order as u want when u have a menu?? This is not common for other branch of baba rafi . I want management to look into this and take needed action on this .thanks .,2.0,;
I did order from pathao. And The food was totally cold. It was beef fried chicken. It is the second time and last time.,,False;
It's good actually. The only problem i had was from a new item that i had yesterday. It was Tandoori Burger. It was too hot and spicy but was not mentioned in the description. It tasted really good, but a bit of heads up in the description would have been much better.,4.0,;
Burger patty is very disappointingly tasteless and too much mayo that also didn't taste good. Incomplete menu,,False;
Whatâ€™s up with your cost saving techniques? Ac out fans running, one man doing cash, preparation and serving. If you claim to be an international chain but serve like a local street shop. Literally, one guy taking 5 customers orders and the place is just crazy hot without AC. Terrible. Banasree Outlet.,1.0,;
They have the worst food possible. the chicken fry was all raw from inside. It had clotted blood and reddish pink flesh. When asked about this to the waiters, they said it was calcium coming out of bones, not clotted blood. i request everyone not to eat at baba rafi for ur own sake. u may end up with some bad disease for consuming these awful food.,,False;
Ordered the kebab and was really surprised by the quantity of beef and other ingredients. i had to eat half the oily bread and then got the taste of the kebab. This is unacceptable from a food chain of this calibre. Serve your food the way it shows on the menu and dont deceive your customers.,2.0,;
i tasted the chicken kebab and was really great!,,True;

I WAS ASKED TO LEAVE BY THE MANAGER BECAUSE I COMPLAINED OF WAITING OVER 20 MINS TO PLACE AN ORDER WHEN THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON IN FRONT OF ME! Yeah that person has a right to place the order but my problem is BRafi didn't bring anyone up to help take orders. Apparently baba rafi doesn't care about your time.

We had the following (opposite NSU main gate 1 & 2): 1 Beef Burger = 99 Taka. Was pretty good. Loved the buns they use. The patty was good for the price range, despite being doused with a lot of sauce. Also, it is a very messy burger so make sure you get tissues. 2 Chicken Burgers = 198 Taka. The chicken burger is definitely the best item on the menu. Delicious patty which complements the soft sesame buns. They use the same sauces for both the beef and chicken burgers. Howeve...r, the sauce combo tastes much better with the chicken patty. 1 Beef Kebab = 99 Taka. The packaging is nice, the kabab wrap is decent. It is definitely not worth getting this for 99 taka. Also, the beef kebab has star anise in it, so if you don't like the smell of star anise, stay away from it! 1 Chicken Kebab = 99 Taka. Again, the chicken version is much better than the beef version. Still not worth 99 taka IMO. The meat to veggie ratio is waaaay off. They need to put more meat in this to be worth 99 taka. Tastes pretty good though. 1 Mountain Dew = 60 Taka. Regular fountain drink glass (not the tiny ones they give you at KFC or other places). Expensive yes, however it was pretty refreshing. Tasted like proper mountain dew (not some watered down version of it). Recommendations = stick to the chicken burgers. Definitely worth it!,4.0,;
went to Baba rafi 300 feet Bashundhara r/a they only serve 100 and 160 tk combo burger deal! One of the best burger in that price,, but i have to give points to fries,,its similar to Mcdonalds fries and Hungry Jacks i had in Australia. Beef Burger was juicy and the sauce they used was really nice with a hint of Garlic Im gonna be honest, i had most amount of burgers around dhaka from banani, malibag and mirpur, dhanmondi and 300 feet... Baba rafi beats all in price and taste and with excellent cooked fries! Top quality. Thats why i had two burgers!! N.B- every place we been to, customer service is never satisfactory, but this girl in baba rafi,,,she was kind, explainable and also served with smile where she was wearing hijab and with decency,,,5star for because she did that.

Now this is confusing . How can a shop have 68 5 stars and 34 1 stars? Some r sayin faltu, shit, rotten meat, served cold. Some are sayin they didnt find any meat in it, it was just tomato n onion or even thr service is slower than granny . N some r saying this is the best burger in town, nothing is better than this. Is it like the owner pushed his friends to give good reviews ? Or is it like those who suffered are mean enough to want others to suffer as well? Didnt try anything yet .

I have just finished their wari pasta. it was so yummy. Thank u so much for the offer of buy one get one pasta :-),,True;
I ordered food using Pathao app. The restaurant calls me and say that price have changed and I have to pay about 250 taka more per items that I ordered. According to them the price did not get updated even though had changed the menu price. I agreed since didn't have much time to order again. Now the rib eye steaks that I ordered cost me 850 each. I received the items on time. The meat was not at all juicy and was so hard that I started to feel fatigue and pain i n my hand to cut. I couldn't finish it neither could my father. The price is excessively high and then you get something like this. I would have walked out if I was served it in the restaurant. The only thing that was good was the mashed potato tasted good.,1.0,;

Good food, good service and live show: The restaurant took the effort to cut through the menues which are no more available. Thumbs up for that. Plus the foods are good and freshly prepared. We were satisfied with the T-Bone steak (preparation time and taste) and Chicken Wrap. My kid loved the live performance. The service was smart and polite. Most likely among the best all rounder restaurent in the Khilgaon food street. However, I have bad experience in restaurants where they were good, and became lathergik later.

Tasty foods, nice environment, good location!,,True;
The food was really good and tasted like I expected, the service was praiseworthy too. But the atmosphere however can get pretty noisy, probably due to the low ceiling and square rooms. I hope they can expand in the future and get a spacious place so it doesnâ€™t feel this congested. This place has a lot of potential!,4.0,;
An excellent place with good food. Service needs to improve. Heavily understaffed. Good arrangement of the seats as well. But the taste of they makes up for everything else.,4.0,;
One of my favorite restaurant in Dhaka. Very peaceful environment and yummy foods.,5.0,;
Very good. To be excellent, below are few suggestions - 1. Some kinda smell is there in the restaurant. Probably coming from kitchen. The exhaust is probably not functioning well. 2. Quantity is low in view of the price. Overall very good food, place, service.,4.0,;
The foods were really tasty, I should agree. But, the price is way too high compared to their quantity. Quality, Ambience, Service were too good. I didn't like their sea food assorted something, that dish had small crabs mostly which was not at all tasty. Price was 870/- including the VAT, but the amount was so less.,4.0,;
Good food, with good taste. I liked it, you guys may try, hope you gonna love it,,True;
Amazing ifter platter. They give you exactly what they show in the photos and all the items taste delicious ï¿½,5.0,;
The first order Which was a salad came after 30mins.Then, Suddenly there was a blackout. I am expecting hence got really unwell in that hot atmosphere. The main course was Fried Rice Beef Bulgogi and a shrimp dish.The fried rice and Bulgogi was quite disappointing.Fried rice was not even mixed properly. Overall Very very disappointed.,,False;
If not for anything else I had to come to the page and write a review for the lamb itself..!! I usually never ever try lamb in restaurants but man did this blow me awayï¿½ U MUST TRY THE LAMBï¿½ Overall I liked all the foods and we literally tried everything on the menuï¿½ The servers are also very polite and well-mannered.. All in all-the place maybe named 'Little Korea' but it has some big bold bang flavours waiting for u.. Will definitely come againï¿½,5.0,;
"Guys I'm sorry but your food tastes like Poorly cooked Indian food, might consider renaming the place to ""Little India"". I threw up after eating at Little Korea last week and I would not recommend anyone to come 5Kms within the place until you get chefs that can make decent food.,,False";
The food is good, service excellent. Salads and starters are tasty. Lambs are juicy but the sea food platter is insufficient. Kimchi was absent, chopsticks and crockeries are poor. Interior has to be improved a lot. The entry steps are risky, please try to reconstruct it properly.,3.0,;

We ordered assorted seafood, fried rice , chicken with dry chilli and bevarage . The quantity was good for two people . But the price was really high compared to the quantity . The fried rice was cold and the chicken was hard. Would I visit there second time ? No.,3.0,;
"1. Awful service. No one greeted or showed us where to sit. One of the waiters failed to fetch us a bottle of water. 2. The food is at best mediocre for the price. They are charging premium price. The service and the quality of the food should really be up to the mark. I'd be happy to change this review if they manage to improve. When you say ""from the founders of Tokyo Express"", it really is hard to cut them some slack.,1.0,";

Nice and tasty food, Very good service, good environment. But food qauntity should be a little more.,,True;
I had my iftar in Paprika yesterday.The taste of the continental iftar platter 3 was good but the food were served way too earlier (even we saw our plates arranged in the kitchen long before they were served) which eventually turned them cold..they should have served or at least should have tried to serve the food hot..the steak, therefore, turned hard to cut. I was even more disappointed with their service as i had booked the seat 1 week ago. I asked the window side seats. ...,3.0,;
Their AC is old, second hand, dont work properly and last day water was coming from the AC..i have changed my seat several times due to the hot temp...their service aint that bad but they should take care their customerâ€™s comfort.
